  "prompt": "main",
  "actual_response": "Angular Signals in version 17 introduce a new reactive primitive designed to enable fine-grained, efficient, and glitch-free reactivity within Angular applications. The main features of Angular Signals in version 17 are:\n\nStable Signals API: Signals, introduced in Angular 16 as a developer preview, became stable in Angular 17. They provide a simple reactive building block that holds a value and notifies consumers when the value changes, enabling a more fine-grained change detection mechanism than the traditional Angular change detection system [1.],  [2.].\n\nLocal Change Detection: Signals enable 'local change detection,' meaning that only components with changed signal values are checked and updated, rather than the entire component tree or large parts of it. This leads to improved performance and reduced client load [1.],  [2.].\n\nImmutable Signal Handling: The ability to mutate signals directly (e.g., via signal.mutate()) was removed in Angular 17. Signals must now be treated as immutable data structures, and updates should be performed using the signal.update() method to ensure consistency and proper change propagation [1.],  [2.].\n\nNew Lifecycle Hooks: Angular 17 introduced new lifecycle hooks related to signals — afterRender() and afterNextRender() — which allow developers to run code after the component has been rendered. These hooks are designed to work smoothly with the signals-based change detection [1.].\n\nInterop with RxJS: Signals are designed to complement RxJS rather than replace it entirely. Angular provides interop utilities to convert between signals and observables (toSignal() and toObservable()), allowing developers to combine the simplicity of signals with the power of RxJS operators when needed [3.].\n\nSignal-based Component Inputs and Outputs: Angular 17 added support for signal-based component inputs and outputs, replacing the traditional @Input() and @Output() decorators with signal-based APIs (input(), model(), and output() methods). This simplifies component communication and aligns with the reactive paradigm [4.].\n\nImproved Template Syntax and Control Flow: While not exclusively part of signals, Angular 17 introduced a new control flow syntax (@switch, @case, @default, @defer) that works well with signals and enhances template expressiveness and performance, including lazy loading capabilities [1.].\n\nBackward Compatibility and Migration: Signals are fully backward compatible and interoperable with existing Angular code. Developers are encouraged to adopt signals incrementally, with tooling support to ease migration [4.].\n\n\nIn summary, Angular Signals in version 17 provide a stable, efficient, and developer-friendly reactive primitive that enables local change detection, immutable state handling, and seamless integration with RxJS and Angular’s component model. These features collectively contribute to improved performance, simpler state management, and a more modern Angular development experience [1.],  [2.],  [4.].\nIf you want to dive deeper into practical usage and advanced patterns with Angular Signals, there are also workshops and conference sessions available that cover these topics in detail.",
