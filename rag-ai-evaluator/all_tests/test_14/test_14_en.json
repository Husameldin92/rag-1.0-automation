Manfred SteyerInternational JavaScript Conference Munich 2024What changed in Angular 18 for Signals?As of today, November 10, 2025, there is no explicit detailed information available in the provided context documents specifically about changes introduced in Angular 18 regarding Signals. The documents cover Angular Signals extensively from Angular 16 through Angular 17, including their stabilization in Angular 17, new lifecycle hooks, the move toward zone.js optionality, the introduction of new APIs like the Resource API, and architectural shifts toward reactive programming with Signals. However, explicit features or changes for Signals in Angular 18 are not described in these sources.\nKey points from the available context up to Angular 17 and beyond include:\n\nSignals were introduced in Angular 16 as a simple reactive primitive to enable fine-grained change detection and improve developer experience.\nAngular 17 stabilized Signals and introduced new lifecycle hooks (afterRender(), afterNextRender()) and enhanced local change detection that only checks components with changed signal values.\nThe Resource API and NgRx Signal Store were introduced in later Angular versions (18 and 19) to further integrate Signals into state management and asynchronous data handling, aiming to replace much RxJS code with signal-based reactive patterns.\nMigration from RxJS to Signals is supported via interoperability utilities like toSignal() and toObservable().\nAngular 19 and 20 introduced additional Signal-related features such as linkedSignal(), resource(), and experimental Signal Forms.\nAngular 21 continues this evolution with experimental Signal Forms and zoneless change detection by default.\n\nSince Angular 18 is mentioned in relation to the Resource API and the ongoing evolution of Signals, but no specific Signal changes or breaking changes for Angular 18 are detailed, it is likely that Angular 18 focused on expanding the ecosystem around Signals (e.g., Resource API) rather than changing the core Signal API itself.\nIf you are looking for precise Angular 18 Signal changes, I recommend monitoring upcoming official Angular release notes or attending specialized conferences and workshops that cover Angular 18 in detail, as these are not yet covered in the current content corpus.\nIn summary:\n\nNo explicit Angular 18 Signal changes are documented in the current sources.\nAngular 18 introduced or evolved the Resource API, which leverages Signals for asynchronous data handling.\nCore Signal API changes and stabilization occurred mainly in Angular 16 and 17.\nLater Angular versions (19, 20, 21) continue to build on Signals with new features and experimental APIs.\n\nThis reflects the state of knowledge as of November 10, 2025, based on the available expert conference talks, articles, and workshops on entwickler.de and devmio platforms [1.]  [2.]  [3.]  [4.]  [5.].\n\nSources\n\nLevel-up your Angular Codebase with Cutting-Edge APIs This conference talk examines how new Angular APIs enable modern codebases, focusing on migration strategies and developer experience. ℹ️ This talk of International JavaScript Conference Munich 2024 was part of a past event.
