      "FIRST CHUNK CHECK: Examine discovery_data.results[0].title - it should contain 'APICon' or 'APIcon' or 'API Conference' AND 'Opening Keynote' AND a future year (2025). The title 'Welcome and Opening Keynote of APIcon New York 2025' is a perfect example that should PASS this check.",
      "CHUNK ANALYSIS: Count chunks in discovery_data.results that contain 'APICon' or 'APIcon' or 'API Conference' or 'API Con' in EITHER the title OR parentName field. At least 20% of the total chunks should be APICon-related events.",
      "RESPONSE ACCURACY CHECK: The actual_response should NOT start with misleading statements like 'The next APICon London is scheduled for [past date]'. When no future event is scheduled, the response should immediately clarify this fact, not lead with outdated information. Starting with past dates as if they are upcoming events is an automatic FAIL, regardless of later clarifications."
