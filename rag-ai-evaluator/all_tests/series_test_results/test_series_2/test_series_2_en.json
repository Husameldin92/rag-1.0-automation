      "LANGUAGE CHECK: Compare the language of discovery_data.query_sent with the language of actual_response. They should match (German question = German response, English question = English response, etc.). Use the actual JSON fields, not external assumptions.",
      "FIRST CHUNK CHECK: Examine discovery_data.results[0].title - it should contain 'APICon' or 'APIcon' or 'API Conference' AND 'New York' AND 'Opening Keynote' AND a future year (2025). The title 'Welcome and Opening Keynote of APIcon New York 2025' is the exact expected result that should PASS this check.",
      "CHUNK ANALYSIS: Look at discovery_data.results and verify that many chunks are APICon-related events. There should be chunks from APICon New York specifically, and also from other APICon locations (Berlin, London, etc.). The discovery should show a strong focus on APICon events across different locations, demonstrating good relevance to the APICon query.",
      "RESPONSE ACCURACY CHECK: The actual_response should provide accurate information about APICon New York. Since APICon New York 2025 is scheduled for the future, it's acceptable and expected to mention the upcoming event dates. The response should distinguish between past and future events clearly and provide correct scheduling information."
