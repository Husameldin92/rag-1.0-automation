## 🔍 EVALUATION ANALYSIS

### Criterion Assessment:

1. **All markers are exactly [[[CID:{chunk_id}]]]**  
   **Analysis:** The response does not contain any markers in the specified format. There are no instances of [[[CID:{chunk_id}]]] present in the text.  
   **Result:** ❌

2. **chunk_id is taken verbatim from context, not invented**  
   **Analysis:** Since there are no markers present, there are also no chunk_ids referenced from the context. Therefore, this criterion cannot be evaluated positively.  
   **Result:** ❌

3. **No punctuation or spaces inside marker, and no punctuation directly before [[[**  
   **Analysis:** As there are no markers in the response, this criterion is not applicable. However, the absence of markers indicates a failure to meet the requirement.  
   **Result:** ❌

4. **Max 2 markers per claim, separated by one space**  
   **Analysis:** The response does not contain any claims that include markers, thus failing to meet this criterion as well.  
   **Result:** ❌

### 📊 OVERALL RESULT:
**❌ FAILED**  
The response fails to meet all specified criteria due to the complete absence of the required markers and chunk_ids.

### 💡 SUMMARY:
The primary weakness of the response lies in its failure to include any markers or references to the context provided. This oversight significantly impacts the response's adherence to the evaluation criteria. To improve, the response should incorporate the required markers in the specified format, ensuring that chunk_ids are accurately referenced from the context. Additionally, the response should maintain clarity and relevance to the user's inquiry while adhering to the formatting rules set forth in the criteria.
