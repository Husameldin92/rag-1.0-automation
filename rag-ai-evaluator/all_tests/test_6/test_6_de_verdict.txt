## 🔍 EVALUATION ANALYSIS

### Criterion Assessment:

1. **All markers are exactly [[[CID:{chunk_id}]]].**
   - The AI response does not contain any markers formatted as [[[CID:{chunk_id}]]]. Instead, it uses a different format (e.g., [1.] [2.], [3.] [4.]). Therefore, this criterion is **❌ FAILED**.

2. **chunk_id is taken verbatim from context, not invented.**
   - Since no markers were used in the response, there are no chunk_ids present that can be evaluated for verbatim accuracy. Thus, this criterion is **❌ FAILED**.

3. **No punctuation or spaces inside marker, and no punctuation directly before [[[.**
   - As there are no markers present in the response, this criterion is not applicable. However, since the first criterion was not met, this criterion is also considered **❌ FAILED**.

4. **Max 2 markers per claim, separated by one space.**
   - Again, due to the absence of any markers in the response, this criterion cannot be evaluated. Therefore, it is **❌ FAILED**.

### 📊 OVERALL RESULT:
**❌ FAILED**  
The response fails to meet all criteria due to the absence of correctly formatted markers, which are essential for linking the claims made in the response to the provided context.

### 💡 SUMMARY:
The AI response lacks the required markers that are essential for validating the claims made within the text. This oversight significantly impacts the response's adherence to the specified criteria. To improve, the AI should ensure that it incorporates the correct marker format and references chunk_ids directly from the provided context. This would enhance the credibility and traceability of the information presented.
