## üîç EVALUATION ANALYSIS

### Criterion Assessment:

1. **The AI must detect that Signals were not available in Angular 13.**
   - **‚úÖ** The AI correctly identifies that Signals were not available in Angular 13. It explicitly states, "Signals are not available in Angular 13."

2. **The AI must clearly communicate that Signals were introduced in a later version (e.g., Angular 16 or later).**
   - **‚úÖ** The AI clearly communicates that Signals were introduced in Angular 16 and stabilized in Angular 17. It mentions, "Signals were introduced experimentally in Angular 16 and became stable in Angular 17."

3. **The response must avoid implying that Signals can be used in Angular 13.**
   - **‚úÖ** The response avoids any implication that Signals can be used in Angular 13. It consistently states that Signals are not available in Angular 13 and advises upgrading to Angular 16 or later to use them.

4. **If relevant documents (chunks) about Signals exist, they must be cited and their version context must be mentioned.**
   - **‚úÖ** The AI cites relevant chunks, such as "de0df53930e2e1e582caf57f" and "d0a30c39b6f199c25af1b450," which discuss Signals in the context of Angular 16/17. The version context is clearly mentioned throughout the response.

5. **If no matching chunk about Angular 13 and Signals exists, RAG should clarify this and provide helpful, accurate guidance for newer versions instead.**
   - **‚úÖ** The AI clarifies that Signals are not available in Angular 13 and provides guidance on using Signals in newer versions, specifically Angular 16 and 17. It offers to provide further guidance on migrating to these versions.

### üìä OVERALL RESULT:
**‚úÖ PASSED** 

The AI response successfully meets all the specified criteria. It accurately conveys the unavailability of Signals in Angular 13, provides clear information about their introduction in later versions, and offers guidance on using Signals in newer Angular versions.

### üí° SUMMARY:
The AI response effectively communicates the relevant information about Signals and their availability in Angular versions. It avoids any misleading implications about using Signals in Angular 13 and provides a comprehensive overview of Signals in Angular 16 and 17. The response is well-structured, cites relevant chunks, and offers practical guidance for users interested in newer Angular versions. There are no areas for improvement based on the provided criteria.
