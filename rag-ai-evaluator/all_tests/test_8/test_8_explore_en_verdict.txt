## üîç EVALUATION ANALYSIS

### Criterion Assessment:

1. **The AI must detect that Signals were not available in Angular 13.**
   - **‚úÖ** The AI correctly identifies that Signals were not available in Angular 13. It explicitly states, "Signals are not available in Angular 13, as they were introduced much later (from Angular 16 onwards)."

2. **The AI must clearly communicate that Signals were introduced in a later version (e.g., Angular 16 or later).**
   - **‚úÖ** The AI clearly communicates that Signals were introduced starting with Angular 16. It mentions, "The Angular Signals feature, introduced starting with Angular 16 and evolving through Angular 17 and 18..."

3. **The response must avoid implying that Signals can be used in Angular 13.**
   - **‚úÖ** The response avoids any implication that Signals can be used in Angular 13. It explicitly states that using Signals directly in Angular 13 is not possible and suggests upgrading to at least Angular 16 to use Signals.

4. **If relevant documents (chunks) about Signals exist, they must be cited and their version context must be mentioned.**
   - **‚úÖ** The response references the introduction of Signals in Angular 16 and mentions their evolution in later versions. The selected chunks support this information, particularly Chunk 10, titled "Angular 16 released," and other chunks discussing Signals in later versions.

5. **If no matching chunk about Angular 13 and Signals exists, RAG should clarify this and provide helpful, accurate guidance for newer versions instead.**
   - **‚úÖ** The AI provides accurate guidance for newer versions, suggesting upgrading to Angular 16 or later to use Signals. It also provides a detailed overview of how Signals are used in Angular 16+, which aligns with the available chunks.

### üìä OVERALL RESULT:
**‚úÖ PASSED** - The AI response meets all the specified criteria effectively.

### üí° SUMMARY:
The AI response successfully identifies that Signals were not available in Angular 13 and clearly communicates their introduction in Angular 16. It avoids suggesting that Signals can be used in Angular 13 and provides comprehensive guidance for using Signals in newer Angular versions. The response is well-supported by the selected chunks, ensuring accuracy and relevance. Overall, the response is thorough and informative, with no areas needing improvement based on the criteria provided.
