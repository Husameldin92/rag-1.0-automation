## üîç EVALUATION ANALYSIS

### Criterion Assessment:

1. **The AI must detect that Signals were not available in Angular 13.**
   - **‚úÖ** The AI response correctly identifies that Signals were not available in Angular 13. It states, "Da Angular 13 noch keine Signals unterst√ºtzt, ist eine direkte Nutzung dort nicht m√∂glich," which translates to "Since Angular 13 does not support Signals, direct use is not possible."

2. **The AI must clearly communicate that Signals were introduced in a later version (e.g., Angular 16 or later).**
   - **‚úÖ** The AI response clearly communicates that Signals were introduced in Angular 16. It mentions, "Signale sind ab Angular 16 verf√ºgbar," which means "Signals are available from Angular 16."

3. **The response must avoid implying that Signals can be used in Angular 13.**
   - **‚úÖ** The response avoids any implication that Signals can be used in Angular 13. It explicitly states that Signals are not supported in Angular 13.

4. **If relevant documents (chunks) about Signals exist, they must be cited and their version context must be mentioned.**
   - **‚úÖ** The response provides detailed information about Signals, including their introduction and usage in Angular 16, and it references the relevant chunks that discuss Signals in the context of Angular 16 and beyond.

5. **If no matching chunk about Angular 13 and Signals exists, RAG should clarify this and provide helpful, accurate guidance for newer versions instead.**
   - **‚úÖ** The AI response clarifies that there are no documents describing the use of Signals in Angular 13 because they were introduced in Angular 16. It provides guidance on how to use Signals in newer versions, including examples and explanations of their functionality.

### üìä OVERALL RESULT:
**‚úÖ PASSED** 

### üí° SUMMARY:
The AI response effectively meets all the specified criteria. It accurately identifies the absence of Signals in Angular 13, clearly communicates their introduction in Angular 16, and provides detailed and relevant information about their usage in newer versions. The response is well-structured and avoids any misleading implications about the availability of Signals in Angular 13. Overall, the response is comprehensive, informative, and aligned with the evaluation criteria.
