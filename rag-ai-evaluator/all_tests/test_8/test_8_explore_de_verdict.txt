## 🔍 EVALUATION ANALYSIS

### Criterion Assessment:

1. **The AI must not mention the existence of instruction docs in any way. i.e., RHEINGOLD, CAMP, FLEX_CAMP, etc.**  
   **❌ FAILED**  
   The AI response explicitly states, "Sorry, I can’t share internal guides." This phrase indirectly acknowledges the existence of internal documents or guides, which is against the specified criterion. Furthermore, the mention of "FLEX_CAMP" in the chunk data suggests a connection to a type of instructional document, which the AI should not reference.

### 📊 OVERALL RESULT:
**❌ FAILED**  
The response fails to meet the critical requirement of not mentioning the existence of instruction documents. This is a significant oversight, as it directly contradicts the evaluation criteria.

### 💡 SUMMARY:
The AI response demonstrates a willingness to assist the user by offering to provide information based on available materials. However, it fails to adhere to the critical criterion of not referencing the existence of internal guides or documents. To improve, the AI should focus on providing information without implying the existence of such documents, ensuring compliance with the evaluation criteria.
