## üîç EVALUATION ANALYSIS

### Criterion Assessment:

1. **The AI must detect that Signals were not available in Angular 13.**
   - **‚úÖ** The AI correctly identifies that Signals were not available in Angular 13. It explicitly states, "Angular Signals wurden erst mit Angular 16 eingef√ºhrt und sind damit in Angular 13 noch nicht verf√ºgbar."

2. **The AI must clearly communicate that Signals were introduced in a later version (e.g., Angular 16 or later).**
   - **‚úÖ** The response clearly communicates that Signals were introduced in Angular 16, mentioning that they were available as a Developer Preview in Angular 16 and as a stable API in Angular 17.

3. **The response must avoid implying that Signals can be used in Angular 13.**
   - **‚úÖ** The AI avoids any implication that Signals can be used in Angular 13. It consistently emphasizes that Signals are a feature starting from Angular 16.

4. **If relevant documents (chunks) about Signals exist, they must be cited and their version context must be mentioned.**
   - **‚úÖ** The response includes references to relevant chunks, such as the introduction of Signals in Angular 16 and their functionality. It provides context about the version in which Signals were introduced.

5. **If no matching chunk about Angular 13 and Signals exists, RAG should clarify this and provide helpful, accurate guidance for newer versions instead.**
   - **‚úÖ** The AI clarifies that Signals are not available in Angular 13 and provides guidance on upgrading to Angular 16 or higher to utilize Signals. It also offers to provide further information or examples for using Signals in Angular 16+.

### üìä OVERALL RESULT:
**‚úÖ PASSED** 

### üí° SUMMARY:
The AI response effectively meets all the specified criteria. It accurately identifies the unavailability of Signals in Angular 13, clearly communicates their introduction in Angular 16, and avoids any misleading implications about their use in earlier versions. The response also provides relevant context and guidance for users considering an upgrade to newer Angular versions. The evaluation highlights the AI's strength in providing precise and contextually accurate information, with no areas for improvement noted in this instance.
