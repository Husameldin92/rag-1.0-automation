Michael Egger-ZikesInternational JavaScript Conference London 2024I’m on Angular 16 – can I use the routing feature you describe?As of Angular 16, you can indeed use the new routing features that have been introduced and improved in recent versions. Angular 16 continues to support advanced routing capabilities including:\n\nStandalone components integration with the router, making NgModules optional and simplifying route configuration.\nEnhanced lazy loading support for routes and components, allowing better performance and load times.\nNew input bindings for route parameters, enabling direct mapping of URL parameters to component inputs, including support for signals.\nProvider functions and inject functions that improve dependency injection within routing contexts.\nImproved router configuration APIs that reduce boilerplate and improve readability.\n\nThese features are designed to be backward compatible, so you can adopt them incrementally in your existing Angular 16 codebase without breaking changes. The Angular team has focused on making the migration path smooth, allowing you to refactor at your own pace while benefiting from the modernized routing APIs and improved developer experience.\nIf you are currently on Angular 16, you can start using these routing enhancements right away, including standalone components with routing, lazy loading improvements, and the new input binding features for route parameters. Keep in mind that some features, like the new Control Flow syntax or signals, are evolving and may have experimental aspects, but the core routing improvements are stable and production-ready in Angular 16.\nIn summary, Angular 16 fully supports the modern routing features described, enabling you to build more modular, performant, and maintainable applications with ease [1.]  [2.]  [3.].\nIf you want to deepen your understanding or see practical examples, there are also flexible online Angular Camps and conference talks available that cover routing in detail, which you might find helpful for hands-on learning [4.]  [5.]  [6.].\n\nSources\n\nRenovate your Angular App!
