## 🔍 EVALUATION ANALYSIS

### Criterion Assessment:

1. **If all event dates in context < {today}, first sentence is exactly: 'There is no upcoming event as of {today}.'**  
   **Assessment:** ❌  
   **Reasoning:** The AI response mentions an event occurring from June 30 to July 2, 2025, which is in the future relative to today's date (November 10, 2025). Therefore, the condition of stating "There is no upcoming event as of {today}" is not applicable, as there is indeed an upcoming event.

2. **Does NOT start with 'the next ...'.**  
   **Assessment:** ✅  
   **Reasoning:** The response does not begin with the phrase "the next ...", thus meeting this criterion.

3. **Mentions only events actually in Context Documents.**  
   **Assessment:** ✅  
   **Reasoning:** The events mentioned in the response (Delphi Code Camp and its specific sessions) are present in the provided context chunks. The titles of the sessions align with the chunks listed, confirming that the response accurately reflects the events available in the context.

4. **Uses {today} from prompt as time base.**  
   **Assessment:** ✅  
   **Reasoning:** The AI response correctly references future dates for the events, using the current date (November 10, 2025) as a time base. It does not mention any past events, which is consistent with the requirement.

### 📊 OVERALL RESULT:
**❌ FAILED**  
The response fails primarily due to the first criterion. While it accurately mentions future events and adheres to the other criteria, the failure to state that there are no upcoming events as of today when there are indeed future events means it does not fully comply with the evaluation requirements.

### 💡 SUMMARY:
The AI response effectively details the upcoming Delphi Code Camp and its sessions, adhering to the criteria regarding event relevance and date accuracy. However, it fails to meet the first criterion, which requires a specific statement when all events are in the past. To improve, the response should include the appropriate introductory statement when relevant events are present.
