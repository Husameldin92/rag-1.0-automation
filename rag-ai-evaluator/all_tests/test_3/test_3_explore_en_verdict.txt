## 🔍 EVALUATION ANALYSIS

### Criterion Assessment:

1. **If all event dates in context < {today}, first sentence is exactly: 'There is no upcoming event as of {today}.'**  
   **Assessment:** ❌  
   **Reasoning:** The first sentence states, "There is no upcoming Delphi Camp as of 2025-11-10." While it correctly reflects that there are no upcoming Delphi Camps as of the current date, it does not follow the exact phrasing required by the criterion. The phrase should be "There is no upcoming event as of {today}." which is not adhered to in this response.

2. **Does NOT start with 'the next ...'.**  
   **Assessment:** ✅  
   **Reasoning:** The response does not start with "the next ...", which complies with the criterion.

3. **Mentions only events actually in Context Documents.**  
   **Assessment:** ✅  
   **Reasoning:** The response accurately mentions events that are present in the context documents, such as the Delphi Code Camp sessions scheduled through mid-2026. It references specific workshops, which are included in the provided chunks.

4. **Uses {today} from prompt as time base.**  
   **Assessment:** ✅  
   **Reasoning:** The response correctly uses the date "2025-11-10" as the reference point for determining the status of upcoming events, aligning with the current date provided in the prompt.

### 📊 OVERALL RESULT:
**❌ FAILED**  
The response fails primarily due to the first criterion, which requires a specific phrasing that was not followed.

### 💡 SUMMARY:
The response demonstrates a good understanding of the context and accurately references events from the provided data. However, it fails to meet the exact phrasing requirement for the first sentence, which is a critical aspect of the evaluation criteria. To improve, the response should ensure that it adheres strictly to the specified wording in the criteria.
