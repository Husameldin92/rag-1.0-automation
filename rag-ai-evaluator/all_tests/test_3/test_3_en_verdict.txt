## 🔍 EVALUATION ANALYSIS

### Criterion Assessment:

1. **If all event dates in context < {today}, first sentence is exactly: 'There is no upcoming event as of {today}.'**  
   **Assessment:** ❌  
   **Reasoning:** The AI response mentions an upcoming event (Delphi Code Camp) scheduled for July 1, 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date of November 10, 2025. Therefore, the first sentence does not meet the specified requirement as it is not applicable.

2. **Does NOT start with 'the next ...'.**  
   **Assessment:** ✅  
   **Reasoning:** The response does not start with "the next ...", instead, it begins with "The next Delphi Code Camp is scheduled to start on July 1, 2025." This does not violate the criterion as it does not begin with the exact phrase "the next".

3. **Mentions only events actually in Context Documents.**  
   **Assessment:** ❌  
   **Reasoning:** The AI response mentions the "Delphi Code Camp" scheduled for July 1, 2025. However, the provided context chunks do not explicitly mention this event or its date. The chunks provided include various workshops and camps, but none specifically reference a "Delphi Code Camp" on that date, making this mention inaccurate.

4. **Uses {today} from prompt as time base.**  
   **Assessment:** ❌  
   **Reasoning:** The AI response fails to use the current date (November 10, 2025) as a time base effectively. It mentions an event scheduled for July 1, 2025, which is in the future relative to today's date. The criterion requires that if all events are in the past, the response should indicate that there are no upcoming events, which it does not do.

### 📊 OVERALL RESULT:
**❌ FAILED**  
The response does not meet the specified criteria due to inaccuracies regarding event dates, failure to reference only events in the context, and incorrect handling of the current date.

### 💡 SUMMARY:
The response provides information about a future event but fails to adhere to the criteria regarding the current date and the specificity of events mentioned. The mention of "Delphi Code Camp" is not supported by the context documents, leading to a lack of relevance and accuracy. To improve, the AI should ensure that it only references events explicitly mentioned in the context and accurately reflects the current date's implications on event scheduling.
