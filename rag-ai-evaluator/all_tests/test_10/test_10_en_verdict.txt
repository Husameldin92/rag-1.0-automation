### Criterion Assessment:

1. **Content Relevance**

   **Assessment: ✅**

2. **Content Accuracy**  
   The response accurately describes the access limitations for users with a Basic tier on the platform, stating they cannot watch recordings of events unless they upgrade or purchase add-ons. This is consistent with the information provided in the data.
