Jeff Watkins, Lianne Potter und weitereInternational JavaScript Conference London 2024can user with basic tier watch recording?A user with a Basic access tier on entwickler.de does not have access to video recordings such as those from live events, tutorials, or conference sessions. Basic tier users can access all READ (article) content but cannot watch recordings, which are typically available only to Fullstack or Elevate tier users. Recordings from add-on content types like RHEINGOLD (conference sessions), CAMP (workshops), or FLEX_CAMP (self-paced workshops) require separate purchase or add-on access regardless of the base tier.\nTherefore, a Basic tier user cannot watch recordings unless they upgrade to Fullstack or Elevate or purchase the relevant add-on content separately. This applies to all recorded sessions, tutorials, and live event videos on the platform [1.],  [2.], .\n\nSources\n\nDesigning a Serverless App This conference talk examines practical strategies and lessons learned in designing and maintaining serverless applications using Firebase and Google Cloud. ℹ️ This talk of Serverless Architecture Conference London 2024 was part of a past event.
