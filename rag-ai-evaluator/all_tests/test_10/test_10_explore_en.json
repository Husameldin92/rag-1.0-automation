We're sleepwalking into a future nobody asked for, but maybe many fear. How always-on Microphones, Cameras and AI are creating a 'digital panopticon' none of us probably want or need, unless you're Amazon. Should we become 'digital preppers'? Is the privacy and security risk so high, what are the stakes? This is an anthro-technologist view on how dumb an idea the smart revolution is and how we've eroded our social contracts in favour of big tech.\n'parentId': 'cKCGY58YaztJ8GQ9k'\n'parentDescription': The JavaScript Fullstack Conference - Angular, Node.js, React and more\n'indexBrandName': 'InternationalJavaScriptCon'\n'indexSeriesName': 'London'\n'author': 'Jeff Watkins,Lianne Potter'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': Actually this now takes seconds. Um, banning wearables with cameras. No, not, not that one. Not that one. Yeah. But more stuff like the, the Metros built in partnership with RayBan, which presents a new set of challenges for this of the defenders of data, which we all should all care about, really, uh, whether or not we work in cybersecurity. And the idea of this always on lifestyle, which is what a lot of companies are kind of pushed to us. Um, it's saying that we should want, I mean, should make us question really like, did we ask for this? And really do we want this? Imagine a world where these innocuous sunglasses are not worn, not just about town, but In courtrooms, in things like changing rooms during personal and private conversations where privacy should be treasured. I mean, maybe it's not a pair of sunglasses. I mean, I'm looking around the room. Is anyone wearing sunglasses indoor? 'cause I'm certainly not cool if to pull that look off. Doesn't mean you're not cool, but yeah, not a lot of people can pull that off. So maybe those sunglasses are okay, but what about a less obvious device? Feel like the rewind pendant, this records everything you've seen, said, or heard for under $60 for the hardware and under $20 a a month for the subscription. I mean, don't worry though, they take your privacy really seriously. Very Good. But is it rewind we really need to be worried about? Maybe not. I think maybe it's not, maybe these organizations need to be worried about, but what about the people actually wearing it? I mean, like Josh for example, you know, he's taking all this, um, screenshots from what he's coding. What is he gonna do when he takes that to our competitors? Or Randall, when he, he's taking stuff from this rewind pendant to steal all our, um, clients and, um, customers. Oh, what would be really unbearable in my eyes if, you know, someone said, oh, well let's pull the tapes. No, Mike, that's not cool. I don't want you to pull the tapes. Worst. If you've ever had a conversation with your other half and they've turned around and said, I've already told you about that, imagine if they could just pull up the tapes afterwards and say, yeah. Well let's, let's see. I've already told you about that. Could AI bring in the rise of divorces and breakups Maybe?

So for example, I can do match slash users down at the bottom slash uid. So a user will have a UID assigned as part of the authentication. And what I'm effectively saying is that anything inside of that space in the doc in the database, they can read and write their own stuff. And I test the permissions based upon a role that is assigned to them inside of an access control list. And this rule then means that they can write to this location safely. I don't, I, nobody else can do it. They can't make anything up. Now, I do have to do one little thing though, and that is that inside of the cloud function, I have to make sure that the data that they wrote is valid. In other words, I'm gonna double check, okay, you submitted a payment or you submitted a request for payment at this time, is the price correct? I'm gonna make sure that you didn't try to artificially give yourself a $0 transaction, for example. Um, I can do additional data validation at this location as well, but a lot of systems don't have anything like this. So I don't know if AWS or Azure, for example, have a database where I could use this approach where I write directly to the database as opposed to going through an API. Uh, but in Firebase, this is actually the normal way of doing it. And so I do tend to take advantage of that just a little bit because you get more value out of the SDK by doing this. And as I mentioned earlier, because the SDK allows me to like watch locations in the database in real time and get real time updates, I've gotten into the habit of using that database as a communication tool between clients. It also means that once I've created that record, I could sit and watch that record in the database from the application so that whenever the transaction is finalized behind the scenes, which may take anywhere from seconds to minutes, then as soon as that's finalized, the user will get a notification right there in the application, oh, your transaction approved, you're good to go, or whatever, without them having to kind of hang out and wait for it. It's just an, an a passive notification that will happen later. Another type of process that we go through is that you need to be able to register a car. And something that we, we did very early on we're the very, very first app in the world as far as I know to do this. Most of the time, if you have to register a car with a parking service, you\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'vector'\n'score': 0.88037109375\n'normalizedScore': 0.8485901479439371\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.88037109375\n\n'documentId': 'euqZDq2jjs3mEQfY7'\n'chunk_id': '687a5498ec597331b62adf5b'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 16\n'total_parts': 24\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Beyond Tracing: Unpacking Log Data's Untapped Potential\n'parentName': DevOpsCon San Diego 2024\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2024-05-21T08:15:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Over the years we've seen a pattern across some of the use cases that customers have brought to us: they want to monitor the transactions that their business is actually responsible for -- financial trades, packages, calls, payments, etc., and they want their IT ops and engineering teams to start troubleshooting from that vantage point. Conventional wisdom for years has been that distributed tracing (and its predecessor, Application Performance Monitoring) is the right technology to solve these problems. We'll walk through why that might not be the case, and how we've been able to solve these use cases using log data.\n'parentId': 'TWP2gHhmnX5taLeWx'\n'parentDescription': The Conference for CI/CD, Kubernetes Ecosystem, Agile & Lean Business\n'indexBrandName': 'DevOpsCon'\n'indexSeriesName': 'SanDiego'\n'author': 'Kyle Champlin'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': Uh, so that makes the shaping and transformation for our product like super duper easy. Um, I won't do it for the live stream, but if folks wanna see a demo, I like love it. We have a custom language that does all this cool stuff. But that aside, this is not, this doesn't require a vendor to achieve. It does not require sort of just our, our technology exclusively to go do this. I think we make it easier. We do it for a lot cheaper than most folks, which is pretty great. And we can do it at scale, as I mentioned, right? We're doing a petabyte a day of ingest, um, across a whole large number of customers. Um, but logs can tell you a ton of stuff. And so when you look at these individually, you can see a bunch of very boring columns with some actions in them. But when you take the time to sort of shape those and turn them around, you end up with something like this. And I, I blacked out the customer's logo, but, um, this actually has a lot of the stuff we talked about earlier. If you think of it in terms of just high level metrics, I'm a product guy, right? I wanna know like how many things have failed, how many have been successful, that's like a dollar amount that I can typically gr uh, move that into. There's error logs for, for folks that are in sort of first line supporter operations. Uh, you have logs to metrics here. So they're using this to basically convert a not just a sort of a stream of errors into sort of a counter, but a number of other, uh, like there's all these interesting metric data structures, but they can do all of 'em. And I think at the end of the day, what this allows you to also do, which is pretty underrated, is rather than wait months and months and months to do all of that custom instrumentation and try to glue things together and wait for teams to adopt technology, they they may never actually adopt. You can make a tremendous amount of progress and, and get a lot of folks on the proverbial and and literal same page, right? This dashboard has enough value for this customer that it, it's sort of the lifeblood from understanding not just operationally what's happening, but also for the business, right? And that's a pretty cool place to be just on top of logs. So like I've mentioned, that was one particular case, but this is a pattern I've seen repeated over and over again.

This is the paid version of it. If you wanna record and, uh, replay or watch your videos that you have to pay for it. So here are my two tests that I was showing. And then this one, you can run it. These are all the debug stuff. And I'm just gonna go navigate. There are two files. Let's do the login one first. You see, boom, it's super fast, right? So this is the time travel that I was talking about. It visits here, it looks for this, and then it clicks this, and then boom, right? So the next one that I wanted to run was the end-to-end, please watch the screen very, very carefully. There's gonna be a tab that's gonna be opening up on the top here when I click onto this, and it'll be very quick. You see that, you see that, and also see it goes to, uh, dev dot, uh, whatever the, the dev do two, uh, webpage. And it clicks the, the link on the top on top of my thing and comes back. So also note that there's a, uh, there's a, um, reference error that's showing up here, right? When I, when I run this from the terminal, you would not see this, but if you look into it very closely, it shows up something. And if you navigate it through this particular link here, it's going to show something related to chro, uh, chromium browser, or with puppeteer, not, it's not blocking the test for Cyprus, but it's something to do with, um, puppeteer. So in this case, everything passed, uh, because we were just looking for that, uh, text, which is tech, tech enthusiast. So it did pass. However, this reference error will not show up, and you ri run it programmatically from the, um, from the terminal here in VS code. Okay? I think this is the small demo that I wanted to show. Let me go back to my slides if I can. Cool. I wanted to show, but then this is, you just have to run it without, um, the side out open. You just run it as NPX, uh, cypress, it'll, it'll programmatically run. Um, where's my clicker? Cool. So this is the demo that we saw. Optimization. Let's talk about optimization.

Are there any tools for recording the, You can do that with this tool itself. Whatever try you're trying to do it automatically records it, but that's money in. Yeah, it's a paying version of it. So, uh, I know that Selenium, ID used to do that. You can record it and the step by step you, it has that stuff. This used to have that too. You can run and play that, but now the paid version of it, uh, only has that if your company is using, you know, if you, if you can integrate it with a cloud, their cloud, yes. But it's very useful tool. I think four or five years back they did not have it. Yes, sir. Recording is that you're kind of not thinking about your website way, you probably end up with set ID or you'll probably end up with kind of. Yep. And so those exciting thing and get 50% mm-Hmm. At the end of the day writing the test instead of recording them. Mm-Hmm. Probably more durable tests. Mm-hmm. Long valuable tests. Mm-Hmm. And so the recording is Y Yeah, that, that, like I said, record, you know, it's going, like you said, the question was, um, uh, for the people who are online, the question is, um, you know, recording these sessions or the suggestion is recording these suggestions. Uh, no, recording these tests is going to take more time and it's not going to be, uh, effective in, you know, your coverage, right? So yes, I do understand, but at the same time, if you have to do end to end and make sure that, you know, not only recording these things if you don't have a, because I was stuck in a stage where my production en, uh, environment and the q you know, the QA or the staging environment, it's not the same.

Classic streaming has delay about 40 seconds, and video conferencing is, uh, around subsecond, uh, less than 500 milliseconds. So how can we overcome these technical limitations? Very simple. We simply do both. So we have a video conference here, which is the interactive mode. And for example, Dimitri is Athena Carson, this information is for you. Uh, if you want to interact with us, switch to the interactive mode. Uh, if you just wanna watch and, uh, uh, just look what we are doing here. You can, uh, switch to standard mode, uh, and, uh, yeah, follow the, the sessions throughout the day using a classical live streaming experience. Great. So in order to get used to it a little bit, I just want to have a warmup. It's, it's early in the morning. It's Monday. Okay. So I guess you're a little bit tired, maybe from traveling or whatever, or from watching football. Are any football fans here in a room? It's so great. That's the best audience I ever had. I, I actually, I don't know nothing about football, so. Great. Okay. Very cool. Doesn't matter. Uh, what, what I want to do is that you, uh, here on site, just clap your hands for the online audience. So yeah, welcome. Great. And now, and now we do the other things I would like to ask the online participants to applaud for the onsite, uh, people Here, you have an icon. Clap your hands. Icons at the lower, uh, right bottom of the application. Just try. You can't do, uh, any harm. Just try. Please do it. Yeah. Cool. More if you want. Just do it more. Hit it a little bit harder. Okay, Robin. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much. So you see how it works. You can throw your emotions, you can throw your text, anything you like, just throw it on stage, participate with us, don't hesitate. Uh, and just do it so that we can have a real hybrid experience here. Okay. Very cool. That's, uh, it for the start. Before we start with the actual talks, I would like to tell you a little story. And this story is about innovation. I don't know whether you know this thing here. Do you know what it is? Coffee. Coffee? Yeah. Special kind of coffee. Instant coffee. Okay.

If you give your LLM unrestricted permissions, there's no way to monitor. I mean, it's just after the fact. Um, but to effectively monitor, treat your LLM as just another user with permissions now, then you can set boundaries on the tasks, um, that it, it should be able to handle, right? And that's something tangible, um, that you can monitor. So that's the first step, right? So think of this playbook as a litmus test. Um, 'cause this is so new. Like if somebody tries to sell you a quantifiable framework, I mean, it's just so new. So think of it as a series of questions to work through, right? As a playbook, um, to have something, uh, for L and mops and, and security. Um, so next is logging, right? Some people will tell you, yeah, log all that data, put it into a sim security information event management system of sorts, and then read all those behaviors and try to figure out what's going on, right? Having a learning mechanism when there's anomalies, Hey, the dis user all of a sudden try to access this sensitive proprietary technology, or there's really powerful AI capability, right? It is not typical of them to do this, right? So why that request, why that access? You log that and you prompt that, right? You, you audit that. Um, and that's the second step of, of the logging part. Um, then, um, of course, uh, there's policies, right? So think of the Google Safe framework, what Databricks is doing right there. There's policies, there's configurations in place for what needs to happen, uh, as far as like the data, um, and, and accounting for bias, right? This reminds me of a supply chain threat, right? If if the data that you're using contains bias, then that's gonna roll up right to the output of an LLM. So think about the supply chain, um, and then have a way to evaluate the outcomes, right? Um, in, in that output, right? And that has to be part of your policy. Google Save Databricks, um, and some government agencies have great, uh, places to start with what, what that policy should be. Um, and then of course, um, in zero trust, right?

They're already telling you it's recorded, so there's nothing you can do. Yes, you can't use people's faces. So we gotta blur these things out. But you can use the video to a certain extent. Uh, started with the public model, but then we realized over time that this application can grow in multiple ways and it can become cheaper. So what we did is we went to a version two where we built s SLMs to power this application, and we scaled the application as well. So now, apart from looking at the items on the shelf, it also tells you when people spill stuff on the floor, or if there's some sort of a person walking around with a gun, it'll ping that as well, that you know, someone's there with a gun in your store. That as well is there. And we then took this application and we installed it inside the camera. It's literally running in these things, watching around. So it's gone to that small chip level, uh, stuff that we have done again, and then this is possible, uh, to run at a certain extent. Then version three, we figured out this application was growing was a club of SLM. So we took it out of the camera, put it on an tu server running inside the store. So now it runs on a server that is sitting literally in one of the back doors, and that talks to all the cameras live, and then that cameras is powering your, uh, feed. And then the language models are running at the back. Simple. Uh, the reason I show this example is because this is how we even started with public. We turned around and did private, and we figured out it's much simpler to control things can be, we can add more value for clients, uh, they can scale better and cheaper, and there's a lot of customizations that we could do for them. So, and they could do for themselves. It really depends on who's trying to do what. But they could add a lot of things too. So like the spilling algorithm was added on the fly, the threat detection was added on the fly. That's the third one, correct? So similar to that, this thing is growing day by day, and you can just bring in different models to handle this and run it together. So this is one of my favorite examples to show, uh, how we also went from public and realized private was a better solution here. Uh, the things to watch out for in this, uh, example on the right, if you see is obviously the video quality\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'vector'\n'score': 0.8901958465576172\n'normalizedScore': 0.8683909281488146\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.8901958465576172\n\n'documentId': '4doenYnEh5ucx97yT'\n'chunk_id': '687a2bf5495b49563aa87b99'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 15\n'total_parts': 25\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Decoding Enterprise AI for Devs: Choosing Between Private LLMs and Public Generative AI Services\n'parentName': ML Con New York 2024\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2024-10-08T15:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': \n'parentId': 'D26qSfsi7D43xAqFR'\n'parentDescription': The Event For Machine Learning Technologies & Innovations\n'indexBrandName': 'MLCon'\n'indexSeriesName': 'NewYork'\n'author': 'Shomron Jacob'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': If you have it on your phone, you upload a photo, it's there nothing you can do about it. That's how it works. Uh, limited customization, again. Second, uh, especially on the tech side, uh, you might not have a lot of ways to customize these models, uh, as compared to private models. Private models, uh, depending on the, the power you have with the technology knowledge, you can go down deeper and control a lot and change a lot, customize a lot, basically. But in the, uh, for public models, it's gonna be hard to do that because they don't offer a lot of ways of doing that. Correct. Uh, and then obviously you are always dependent on third party services, which basically means you're reliant on the providers, and as long as they work, you work, something goes down there, yours goes down here as well. Normal. This, this can happen with cloud services as well. Like a AWS goes down your server are on too. So that's something people are very well aware of, but it, it's a risk to a certain level, uh, when you use this. So one of the case studies I'll highlight, uh, something that we have done. We started with public, we went to private, that's why I'm trying to show this. Uh, we run this in a convener, uh, convenience store in Arizona. Um, what does it do? It started as a, as the application. Who was going to track? Uh, the application was tracking the products on the app. Simple, nothing fancy, right? What does that mean is as a store manager, when your store gets busy, you don't have a lot of people you should know which thing is finishing where, correct? So it will track these things and it'll ping you on the app to say on aisle five, this product is running low, you should go check it out, correct? And to do that, uh, not a lot of heavy lifting because, uh, these stores already have cameras installed. You don't have to do anything fancy. You tap into the camera, get the feed, and you can build this stuff around. That's what we did. Uh, we started it with public models. Again, because this videos technically to a certain extent are publicly available in a way where when you walk into a store, it says you're being recorded, correct? They're already telling you it's recorded, so there's nothing you can do. Yes, you can't use people's faces. So we gotta blur these things out. But you can use the video to a certain extent.

Rate this talk, uh, onl DA and if you have any other further questions, that would be the moment right now. Also online. Online has a small delay so I dunno, maybe something else will come, but I think it doesn't look like it. So if you have no more further questions, we would have a few more minutes. Maybe you wanna ask something else. Otherwise I'll let you go to eat lunch.

This will be illustrated with examples of how companies have used Cribl to route, reduce, and enrich logs, metrics, and traces, resulting in cleaner telemetry data that reduces observability bills while increasing telemetry control.\n'parentId': '25333a9e5b084d4c60c2a2d6'\n'parentDescription': The Conference for CI/CD, the Kubernetes Ecosystem, Agile & Lean Business\n'indexBrandName': 'DevOpsCon'\n'indexSeriesName': 'London'\n'author': 'Bill Emmett'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': really start think rethinking about how to do, um, with your observability tools. And the last thing is really also thinking about having those data sets driven by our back access and giving people access to that. So once done, it gives you the ability to have a state of data that improves on all of these key fronts. In terms of a data se uh, tiering strategy, one of the things that I do try to avoid is, is all of your data searchable, uh, within an observability tool? Is that all you have access to? And in today's world, the answer is really false. If you have the right architecture in place, you can search data, whether it's in an object store, whether it's in your observability tool, or even all the way out at the end point before, uh, before it's batched and, and found its way over. Another concept is, um, and I think it's really been propagated by observability vendors, is, uh, data, uh, tiering is often thought about as the age of the data. You know, most tools have a retention period of, uh, sometimes seven days, sometimes 30 days. Uh, and, and then it often gets, uh, aged out to some sort of an archive format. Um, now the question is, should that become the basis of what lives in my observability tool and what doesn't or should it become increasingly, uh, what is the kind of data that is best queried in a particular observability tool? And that really changes the dynamics too. If you really start to think about tiering around what are the use cases that you have and where, what the value of that data is, you can really start to flip that crank, uh, thinking. And again, just think about what data is critical, not because of just recency, but because you run dashboards on it. It's critical for alerting. It's the kind of thing that people are going to query on all the time, having a sense of what is important data, which means that people are accessing it, but it's not being actively used for monitoring systems and things like that. And the question is, if there are certain datas I'll get great example here is debug logs. Um, debug logs are things that when you need 'em, you need 'em, but they don't have to go into a 20 some dollars per gigabyte, um, uh, monitoring system in order to gain access to them. You can have a tool that simply, if you had the tool that explores, uh, and can perform a search against those object storage, uh, you're able to\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'vector'\n'score': 0.8814975023269653\n'normalizedScore': 0.8716218076624549\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.8814975023269653\n\n'documentId': '76abe78baf6b1f1bf5a54edc'\n'chunk_id': '68ee16b7e562f600139cfaaf'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 12\n'total_parts': 13\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Securing APIs at Scale - Modern Approaches and Best Practices using API Management tools\n'parentName': API Conference London 2025\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2025-05-13T09:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': As organizations increasingly rely on APIs, managing their security at scale has become a critical challenge for developers and operations teams. With the exponential growth of every organization’s APIs, ensuring robust and scalable security management is more important than ever. In this session, we will explore modern concepts and principles that API Management tools leverage to secure a vast number of provided and consumed APIs. Through discussion and demonstrations, we’ll uncover best practices for safeguarding APIs while maintaining managed security scalability and performance\n'parentId': 'd49e5db0d14a1633e8441dc9'\n'parentDescription': The Conference for Web APIs, API Design & Management\n'indexBrandName': 'APICon'\n'indexSeriesName': 'London'\n'author': 'Andrew Slivker'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': basic earth. Uh, for earth. There will be, uh, quite a bit more configuration parameters that can be associated. In fact, it's, uh, it's UI exposes only. Also on also limited subset. There may be a lot more exposed behind the scene, uh, through more detailed configurations. Uh, but the point I'm trying to make is that these policies registered independently as such in the, uh, catalog. And you can see through the dependencies, like this one, it is used by two APIs. So I can clearly see the dependency, dependency tracking. I can go to jump to that API, which is registered here. It is, that's the one that's registered. And if I look at the endpoint, I will see that its policy uses basic quote, and it is a reference, you see, it says used as a shared policy. So we picked it up, that policy actually from the catalog tree itself, because it is, it is registered here as an independent object, and we reference it, uh, in case of our product. We, we can still, you know, assign private policy, meaning maintain one-to-one relationship and configuration if that's what customers want. But if you want to achieve scalability, you'd better be using references. Very similar thing, um, with the access controls. Uh, and I'll just briefly show the, the idea. So let's say in a folder, I can create the access rule, which can be designed graphically, and I can say, uh, let's say I can say any of these conditions, and I will say, let's say, uh, this particular username, and actually I'll say all of them, any of these, let's say end all, uh, rearrange them by drag and drop. So if the idea, I'm saying if a user a, a, a, and it's, uh, let's say on a particular daytime schedule, and on a particular, let's say also restriction on IP addresses and, uh, with particular transaction count, meaning, uh, particular rate limit, right? I'll specify. So I'm graphically designing my complex combination of conditions, and I can use a lot of them. And once the access rule is created, registered in the repository or in API catalog, so, uh, this is the new rule that I am creating. Once it is registered, I'm not gonna save it. I'm not gonna finish that process. Just show you some example. Well, maybe, um, well, basically what you do, you, you take, uh, any API I'll, I'll just pick some version. You, you go to access control, uh, just like on this one.

So if you're just trying out session replay for the first time and you don't know if you have PII data or sensitive data, you should be safe. You will be safe because it will be masked. And then you can be like, my philosophy is it's better to be like, oh, I'd rather see this. Let me go fix it. Instead of having someone from your legal department come over and be like, I don't want to see that, you have to fix it now. And that all happens on the, on the device. Uh, so let's debug this thing. So in this replay, there's tons and tons of errors and not all of them are coming from the front end. Um, so let's play through and see what we see. So if we hit play, and I'm gonna do that. So this is the session replay, and we're literally able to watch what the user was doing. And here they've clicked submit. And it might have been going slow even on this page when this user was, um, testing things out. So there it goes. See, slowness can pop up at any time. And here they go. It's so slow that they're clicking many, many, many times. And we're gonna come up to an error here. I can see on the timeline. Uh, so yeah, there's the, it's, we've detected all these things. We've detected the rage clicks, we've detected backhand errors. This is an example of how replay is showing you the user experience and connecting all of your data from the front end to the backend. Uh, so one of the errors that I really like to, to, um, demo with is something called an n plus one query. This is something on the backend, and this is the reason why this replay is so slow. So as a backend engineer, you might get a notification about an error like this. Uh, we're doing a select star from our products table product bundles, and we want to know about a specific product id. Uh, what makes this an n plus one error is if we're asking about different product IDs in a loop, what would be better is if we asked for a list of product IDs all at once and then looped over it just in our application. So we only have to talk to the database once. And so as a backend engineer, you're like, okay, I see what the query is. Uh, but you have no idea what the user impact is.

Um, the one I find quite interesting is the permissions policy. That's another HT TB header. And that is something that allows you to specify exactly which kind of browser features that your site makes use of. So say for example, your website doesn't use audio input, so you don't have the ability to, you know, uh, stream video or something from, from your, from your browser. You can say there's no microphone access in this site, but then you have a script that tries to use it, that's gonna be a permissions policy violation, and you can have it report that. And it also uses the report to mechanism and will hit that reporting endpoint for you. Now, there's a problem with getting a third party to receive these things is that if you, if you set up a third party location as the reporting target, it is a privacy issue because you are leaking information to that third party without any knowledge of the client. Um, and that's generally a bad situation to be in from say A-G-D-P-R perspective. Um, because the reports are sent directly by the client, it means that their user agent, their ip, the fact that they're there at all, and the time and the frequency and all the pages within that site that they have visited, uh, across all of your users that have been doing this, assuming they're the ones that actually are all hitting the same errors, you are leaking quite a lot of information to this third party that has no particular reason to know that information other for your technical purposes. And because of that leakage, this is reported by this particular scanner, which I'm a big fan of, um, it will report these third party, um, uh, reporting endpoints as being privacy leaks. And the solution to that really is to proxy that reporting service because although you might want to benefit from all the aggregation and searching and, and reporting features of that third party service, you might not want to have the privacy leak that goes with it. So if you proxy it through your own app, you're gonna lose out on the IP address of the client. And the only thing that that's really gonna affect is things like geographical problems. So say for example, France decides to block PornHub like they did this week, apparently it caused a 10000% spike in VPN registrations. This was literally in the last day. Uh, um, so, uh, they don't want, you don't want this kind of privacy leakage to go on. And so, uh, you can receive the reports yourself and then\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'vector'\n'score': 0.8854694366455078\n'normalizedScore': 0.876795796775518\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.8854694366455078\n\n'documentId': '38212606080841a25b693170'\n'chunk_id': '68f25007d754e200146e6ece'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 16\n'total_parts': 16\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': From GPU Burn‑Rate to Budget‑Friendly: Real‑World Hacks for SFTing Huge LLMs\n'parentName': MLcon New York 2025\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2025-09-30T14:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Supervised fine‑tuning (SFT) is still the gold‑standard for aligning large language models to niche domains, yet training bills can dwarf the project budget.

If you observe every stage, You will observe at earlier stage. If you observe at earlier stage, you'll all get less PagerDuty alerts while sleeping. Uh, and yeah, that's about it. I was speaking about ground cover at the beginning, but uh, yeah, if you want to try out one of this concept, you can try the ground cover. Uh, but uh, questions I think we can use the room until they will kick me out, but, uh, feel free to ask questions. Awesome. Let's see if there is something in the, I'm not sure if there is questions in the Zoom. No, I don't think so. Uh, cool, for those of you want to, uh, uh, see it for yourself, this is not a link to installation. This is a link to a playground. So you literally, you do not need to even install anything in order to experience the concept I was speaking about. Uh, you can just browse to it and it's already populated with the Open Telemetry demo so you can, uh, see it for yourself. If anybody here can tell me that the QR code is working, it'll be great because otherwise that's like my strike theory with marketing and I will just, uh, cool. Awesome. Cool.

Probably you've seen me before like the whole day as always for free to ask any question you might have please at the end of the session and to those of you to our online audience. Feel free to use our chat to ask any question. You might have so cute. The stage is yours. Enjoy our last session and after that I guess we have Expo reception. So enjoy Yeah, thank you Kim. Hello everyone. My name is I'm a data scientist at Vizio. So thank you for for joinings. And today's we will use the presentations about the ai's forward learning recommendations systems using our map and much approach. So is it presentations we will give you some in tourism first, then we will go to the methodologies and finally we will see some applications. Okay, and feel free to to stand the questions if you have any questions on the just if needed. So that you may knows learnings is very essential to honors. We help us to carry out some taxes or help us to do our jobs. It can also help us to advance our carrier. But how do we choose what to learn? For example, when I search the data center this on the customer it will return a thousands results. So it's hard to select one of those. And learning recommendations is\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 37.83793640136719\n'normalizedScore': 0.3783793640136719\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.3783793640136719\n\n'documentId': 'nxjiv9a2td3cJnmH4'\n'chunk_id': '687ad4b9eb1b160a4cabcdab'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 10\n'total_parts': 12\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Serverless Confidential Computing: Ensuring the Integrity and Privacy of User Data\n'parentName': Serverless Architecture Conference - Berlin 2022\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2022-10-19T11:15:00.000Z'\n'abstract': In a world of serverless architecture; how do developers convince their users that they and their code can be trusted?

So this is where I got the functions uploaded to the platform and this is all available in the CLI again. So you can code it with your idea of choice. So then once I've changed the function and this uses a basic encrypt decryption Library, so it just MPN run upload and wait a bit and then it's successfully just uploads that to that project up in my portal. So that's the first one and then here comes the second one. So as you can see, it's been updated. So now I'm going to run my application again. just call a new function. And then it's now telling me. That the code hash did not match the hash provided by the color. So now it's telling me this is not a trusted Enclave. So What I can do here or what I can offer my user as a developer is either say do you still accept these terms so like with the padlock we have for transport layer security. It'll give you a warning if there's no padlock there and telling you the side is on trusted and use the user can decide whether you don't care and you just going to continue or if you decide yeah, I'm going to not go into this so you can do the same with applications that are running with confidential Computing. If you're being told something's wrong. It doesn't match what you've expected use a user can decide. Okay? Yeah. I'm going to leave this or just continue on with it, but we're giving that That choice to the user now. And it protects the user's data. It protects us if we were hacked. So everyone's happy. So here's the code it's so. Seamless to integrate into your applications and we also have a Java SDK. So this is using our JavaScript SDK. So in my react application, I just create. and the conclave SDK object and then I just call it in my functions like so I just imported in college and then me using confidential computing So, thank you. Yep, so that's pretty much that's it. That's it. I'll talk and there's not obviously much time left for the two-day conference.

Either by the user themselves or through like a legal third party. But then this is signed with a cryptographic hash over the code itself. So this means that the code cannot be changed once it has been. Signed and this audit report can be something like an applications permissions whenever you're downloading a smartphone application something like that and then by accepting that report. the user knows exactly what's the what the code is going to do with their data that's going to be processed and they also wear that it cannot be changed otherwise a signature of that and cryptographic hash changes and then it fails So the developer then encrypts and uploads the JavaScript code into the service. And then same as before the user invokes the function that has been uploaded to the service. However, in this case the user encrypts not only the data being passed. To the function, but also the signature of the function that they trust the process to use their data. And again same as before the service will cue the invocation and it will start container for the JavaScript engine to execute in. However, in this instance the JavaScript engine runs inside an international Enclave. And when the code and the user data did the encryption they used a public key where the private key can only be accessed inside this Enclave. and so the JavaScript Enclave will decrypt the code and prepare it. Will then decrypt the user data and the signature. And it's a signature provided by the user does not match. What The Enclave has it will be aborted the invocation is finished. So this provides code Integrity for the JavaScript code and ensures the user knows exactly what code executes over their data. so if that doesn't match an area's return all the way back to the user and it's coming directly from the enclave and the user will know why it was something was changed that they did not agree to and then how do we know the JavaScript engine is the only entity with access to the keys to access the code in the data? For us intellects GX provides a capability that allows end users to verify an attestation from The Enclave that shows that The Enclave is running in a valid intelligence trusted environment. So within conclave Cloud we provide a route of trust Enclave which we call the KDs the key derivation service The user verifies the attestation for just this enclave and it needs to verify it. And then once it's verified that it's a valid KDs Enclave, it will trust that Enclave to distribute private keys to other valid enclaves within the platform for us. This will be the JavaScript Enclave.\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 38.751033782958984\n'normalizedScore': 0.3875103378295898\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.3875103378295898\n\n'documentId': 'bxnsMt8zhSJsMp4i2'\n'chunk_id': '687acad88248193de8e387c8'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 6\n'total_parts': 21\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Making Interactions Accessible to All Users\n'parentName': International JavaScript Conference Munich\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-10-24T08:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Are your websites accessible to all users?

Now, there are other ways to do it. Like instead of this, I could say Aria label and put a text on it. So if I say Aria label, it still works. So Aria label equal to, let's say, favorite, right? Favorite. So it works, but the problem is that sometimes with internationalization, something happened, oh, maybe like this, uh, shouldn't I did, okay. Ah, okay, maybe, oh my God. Anyways, so we can, uh, I think the area works like that, but yeah, uh, so with Aria label, I can still do it, but the problem is that when we are doing any sort of internet, it's the comment, I guess I think I did something with the comment, but yeah. So, uh, anyways, I'll figure it out. But with Aria label, so if there is some internationalization, right? Like if the user is converting it, some other language that might pose issues for the user. So, uh, that's why, uh, if you are targeting users, which might, uh, mean in different language and they are still going to be using your website, then this is another approach. Or you can use something called Aria labeled by. But then again, that text will be visible. So what we want here is we want something where the text is not shown, but still it's in the dorm, so the user can, uh, still hear it. So this is one of the ways, uh, and when we do it, I really don't know what happened, but I'll just do control Z To Maybe just a usable error because this still showing some error with, okay, yeah, refresh it. But anyways, yeah. So now, uh, this should, now, if I start this voiceover Now mm-hmm. Just give me a moment happened. Is this okay, cool. Yeah. Okay, So I'm using voiceover and here it says favorite button group. So now it'll, uh, announce the name and we know that what this button is and what it does, which is a good user experience. Now, another thing is that, uh, there could be some ways in which, uh, some of our controls have some state, right? Like, uh, here it has some state, it's getting favorited and it is getting un favorited. Now, for normal, this scenario, I would maybe use a radio button or a checkbox that could work and we could style it, but I'm showing an example for places where maybe we are not using checkbox or a radio button, but we have some other kind of\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 38.71749496459961\n'normalizedScore': 0.3871749496459961\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.3871749496459961\n\n'documentId': 'uQLGQfccCGQepkM87'\n'chunk_id': '687b42f92b0a1813a73e44fb'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 14\n'total_parts': 23\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Welcome and Opening // Keynote: (Ab)User Experience: How the Dark Side of Product and Security Can Be Used for (Ab)User Stories, (Mis)Use Cases and Threat Modelling\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-05-23T07:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': We start with a welcome and conference introduction, followed by Jeff Watkins and Lianne Potters keynote: Security can often feel like an unapproachable and mysterious part of an organisation – the department of work prevention, the department of 'nope.' But it doesn’t have to be that way. In this talk, we will look at the unintended users of a product, the 'threat agents'. By engaging the security team in the product development process, we can model the dark side of use cases and user stories through threat modelling techniques. This can help demystify impenetrable security NFRs through concrete examples of how these threat agents may try to misuse your shiny new digital product. Who will benefit from this talk? Those building products/apps exposed to the web; people who want to build awareness of possible attack vector use cases (i.e. how might you be attacked); and people who need to write that down as a set of requirements to help build a DevSecOps approach in projects.\n'parentId': 'ghMPhG7rh5aHckuaC'\n'parentDescription': The Conference for PHP & Web Development\n'indexBrandName': 'InternationalPHPCon'\n'indexSeriesName': 'Berlin'\n'author': 'Sebastian Meyen,Jeff Watkins,Lianne Potter'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': the wall mentality. I'm sure we've all been there. It creates a gatekeeping situation where the security team have to say, hold on there. Crucially also ruins any attempt or lean agile approach by blocking work and reducing throughput. So, and this thinking does not promote any autonomy, mastery or purpose in the delivery team. And also security teams just aren't big enough in most organizations and they end up overloaded. So bring them into your team early and they can leave you with the autonomy you so desire. And also we often think that tech security should be, uh, left to the technologists. The technical elements of cybersecurity are incredibly important. After all it is cyber, but the only part of the story, by the time security concerns have reached the technologists, they may be more difficult to fix as they weren't designed in from scratch. But more than that, cybersecurity is often not very user-centric as cybersecurity is not a primary uh, user task. Nobody logs into eBay and goes, well what I wanna do is log in today and they go, no, I wanna buy something. Security is not a primary user task. And as such it can be inconvenient, implemented poorly even if it still meets all your security nfr. So if it's not up to the up to the security team and the technologies alone, who is it then? Well really I think you can guess it should be a whole team concern. Um, but we believe it should start with people like the user researchers and the user experience designers. This means we'll have to think more in terms of form and function than the actual underlying mechanisms. So now we've talked about our team and our attackers motivations. It's time to discuss some of the techniques to help us start thinking like the enemy. It's time to embrace the dark side of user experience, the abuser experience. And this forms the core of product security. There's a number of tools and techniques we've identified only a few of which will have time to go over today, including, or you can see here, I'm not gonna read them all out, but we will go over some of them. We recommend the first time that you try product security techniques to be in a workshop environment so you can actually do it face to face and it'll be more fun there as well. Anyway, so, and start warming up with icebreaker exercises to get the teams thinking like an abuser.

Blog about popover and dialogue. So, uh, it's, it's a complex, uh, component. Now, uh, I want to talk about a place where we can go and understand about all different kinds of interactions and accessibility of any component. So, uh, they're called aria authoring practices. Here I have model open, but they're authoring practices, right? I think I do not have that. Yeah. So why Aria think it's 1.1, 1.2. I think it's going to, yeah, thank you. Cool. So, uh, whenever we are creating something and we get, uh, we think about, okay, how can we make it accessible or we want to know if that is accessible or not, are all the interactions accessible? Accessible or not? Will all the users be able to use my component or not? We can come here and we can see all of our, uh, different, uh, elements, yeah, the patterns. So we can go ahead and check about all the different patterns and we can see if we are implementing in, in that way or not. For example, for a dialogue pattern, I have it open here. Uh, we can go ahead and check that. What are the different types of interaction that can happen? And then we go ahead and check it on our website if all the interactions are working properly or not. For example, here, it gives me all the interactions about keyboard. What happens when we tab it, what happens when we shift tab it, we escape it, and so on. And it, it's a pretty good one. It is for a model when it opens and everything in the background is blurred. So that control is the only control the user can interact with at that point in time. Now, that's one good thing is now H T M L has something called dialogue, which is pretty good, uh, and it actually covers almost everything. We can just use, uh, we can use a dialogue and we can have open properties and we can open this and it's pretty good, right? Like we can close it, open it, that that's, that's pretty good. We can have a model. And one thing, which I see here is, let's say I go here, I press enter, our model opens, and by default, the focus is inside that model.\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 39.9665412902832\n'normalizedScore': 0.39966541290283203\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.39966541290283203\n\n'documentId': 'bxnsMt8zhSJsMp4i2'\n'chunk_id': '687acad88248193de8e387c3'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 1\n'total_parts': 21\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Making Interactions Accessible to All Users\n'parentName': International JavaScript Conference Munich\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-10-24T08:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Are your websites accessible to all users?

Uh, so I'm talking about a topic making interactions accessible to all our users. Uh, the agenda for today is introduction about accessibility and interaction. Then we will see how our users interact with Web and how can we make it accessible for all our users. Uh, this was the introduction about me. I will just make it quickly. Uh, I'm a senior front-end developer, and, uh, yeah, you can connect with me on LinkedIn at ADA 15 or on Twitter at Miracle 4 0 4. Maybe that's the camera. Yeah. So, uh, let's see. First, what is interaction? Interaction is, uh, a contact between user and the web interface, like any website or application, how users contact it, how users may perform some action. And then there is some response from our interface. So this can be termed as interaction. And, uh, how do users interact with web? So, uh, I already asked the room, uh, so I will just go ahead with solutions. So like, uh, some common ways in which we think that users interact with web, uh, are click, we can click, we can type, we can hover, uh, we can scroll, we can these things, right? And these ways users commonly interact with web. Now, accessibility. So what is accessibility? So accessibility means making resources and services usable by everyone regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Disabilities. And why is it important? So, uh, accessibility is important because whatever we are building, we are building for our users, right? And our users can be very diverse. They can have different types of disabilities, and since, uh, there are diverse user, they can have different types of disabilities. Hence, there are different types of assistive technologies which users use to interact with Web. So, uh, apart from just Mouse, right?

Um, this is an example of, uh, how in fact is actually, uh, working. Um, actually, uh, we are something around, uh, in EP group, uh, 800 millions of events per month of tracking. Yeah. Um, so that's my represent a lot of events. Um, but we, um, don't really care about. Um, we don't have any performance issues there because our, um, main point here is about our ability to write gson in S3. And we don't have any limitation to write, uh, stuff on S3. Okay. So we are recording a kind of, a huge amount of event is great, but we don't know exactly what we're tracking. And that was one of the first mission when we created this team. Like, okay, everyone is doing some tracking in, in the, in the company, but we don't know exactly what we have. So we did some monitoring, okay, we want to see exactly how much people are pushing data to, to our data warehouse. We created a tool for this. And, um, it was really helpful to, uh, detect that data issue. Um, it really help us to reduce the amount, like for example, um, if we were able to, um, really catch up that, um, a volume of, uh, customer registration event, for example, really go is, is really going down, uh, and to, um, take some action quickly. So for this, we are, uh, added some, uh, alarms and we have some, uh, slack notifications that will help us to, uh, ally the fact that things are going down. And we also wanted to, um, um, have an event catalog. So our event catalog is, um, a way to, uh, understand exactly what is, uh, in our data warehouse, what kind of different event do we have, how do, since when do they exist, uh, do we still push this kind of, uh, event? Do we use them? And, uh, yeah, knowing what is in data warehouse is much more better. So we, we benchmark different tools. And finally we came with a solution where we, we created our own, uh, uh, Google sheet, which is, uh, updated, uh, daily with new, new, uh, new event. And that was really a game changer for our team because we were knowing exactly what's happening, uh, what kind of, uh, events the team were implemented. Uh, we were able to, um, um, highlight the fact that some engineers were using a category where they only have one\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 39.51133346557617\n'normalizedScore': 0.3951133346557617\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.3951133346557617\n\n'documentId': 'Nbur2qizdoK2Q6i6i'\n'chunk_id': '687a2d869bbcb45d2a11ecae'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 9\n'total_parts': 13\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Capturing Our User Journey!\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2024\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2024-05-29T09:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Improving your product and better understanding your users.

If we want to create a clear seconds of what's happening on the platform, we need the moment. Third one, we need the action. We need the action done by the our user. So in our HDP log, it will be like, get robot ta and then we need more context, we need to add more data, we need to enrich more of this. And in our log, it will be, for example, the user agent. It will be the length of the response, it will be the HTP code. Uh, it's more context. Okay? Um, so that might sound very, um, not really relevant to this kind of event. So let's see, a real world event. Uh, for example, it's kind of formatted as the G and we can see that we have all the marker. We do have the categories, the action performed timestamp. So the moment, a way to identify the users session id. And we do have, um, a list of context. Okay, so now that we have this kind of event, what, how do we track really how do we use, now we have know how to do good event, how do we use it? Uh, so there is different way to do tracking. Mostly two of them are, are a big one. Uh, behavioral tracking. It means that we track how the user react with the platform, how they click slide, uh, interact with yeah, the UI itself. And at the second time we do have domain tracking. And there it will be more about, uh, the action really performed by the user concrete action. Um, let's imagine that, um, as a customer, I will submit a review, uh, for a project, um, in term of bare tracking, I will track the fact that the user, uh, enter some text in the, in the textile area and click on the button to submit it. While on the domain tracking, I will catch an event that will say, okay, this user posted the review, but maybe it was this, um, it did already a lot of review and this new review, um, Halim to become one of our top review of our customer. It's something that is not related to what the user perform as an action, but it's something related to how our business is working. Okay. Um, but now that we know how to do events, the different kind of event, how do we implement this? Uh, so here's a representation of, uh, how we handle with event in our, in our platform.

But it doesn’t have to be that way. In this talk, we will look at the unintended users of a product, the 'threat agents'. By engaging the security team in the product development process, we can model the dark side of use cases and user stories through threat modelling techniques. This can help demystify impenetrable security NFRs through concrete examples of how these threat agents may try to misuse your shiny new digital product. Who will benefit from this talk? Those building products/apps exposed to the web; people who want to build awareness of possible attack vector use cases (i.e. how might you be attacked); and people who need to write that down as a set of requirements to help build a DevSecOps approach in projects.\n'parentId': 'ghMPhG7rh5aHckuaC'\n'parentDescription': The Conference for PHP & Web Development\n'indexBrandName': 'InternationalPHPCon'\n'indexSeriesName': 'Berlin'\n'author': 'Sebastian Meyen,Jeff Watkins,Lianne Potter'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': partly the platform gives you access to those things. You find there are more than 10,000 expert articles in many different technical and digital product development related domains. And of course there are weekly online events, uh, where you can chat also with the speakers and um, um, on, and they are also happening on many different technology areas. And last but not least, you'll find in-depth video tutorials from let's say web design front and development to software architecture and backend technologies. What does it mean for you? First of all, if you're coming from a non-German speaking country, you, we ask you to go to Dev mu and register yourself, you to do the conference check-in. Same for German speakers, uh, German, France, um, um, on, on and Vicla d here you find program information here you can download your certificate after the conference and also you find, uh, your, uh, session slides right after the conference. But not only that, you can watch the conference videos afterwards because everything is being recorded here. On the one hand, we stream everything live, as I said, and stuff is also recorded. You can read all those expert articles, which are just mentioned. You take hands part take, take part in those online live workshop. And last but not least, of course, you watch the video tutorials over there. These things watch conference videos, articles, uh, uh, life workshops and, uh, video tutorials. You find them as a full stack subscriber. And that's what we called, as already said, the full stack experience on deaf for the English folks or the English speaking folks and reading folks and listening folks and on inkler for the German language people. Furthermore, uh, as a subscriber you get 25%, um, discount for additional conferences if you'd like to purchase one of those. Or maybe also for trainings, which are also offering. And last but the least, there are also some offerings for larger organizations in case you are interested. If you'd like to get more information about that, go to the booth in one of the coffee breaks and ask my gentle colleagues. They're happy to talk into you about that. Okay, last but not least, of course, dev Muu and in Vila are accessible of course through the native apps here. You find, of course, um, the program overview. You find the live streams if you want to watch it over here. And, uh, and very important, you can give your feedback to the talks you're listening to. And this is really important.

Uh, when I talk about experimentation, basically it sound like it's a AB test. Who in the audience has already done some AB tests? Okay, nice. Uh, so let's go to the basics. Uh, how do we do, uh, experimentation AB test? Uh, first of all, you need two version. You need the control version, which is a version that you actually do. And then you need a variant, uh, the participant, the new version, the new iteration of your, your feature. Uh, then you need, uh, assignment tools. You need something that will, um, assign to your user, uh, the version that they will, uh, that will belong. And for this, uh, we created a, a library, uh, a few years ago. Uh, if you want to start doing some EB test, um, it's very fast. Don't use any database. Uh, if you want to do a quick EB test, it's really, uh, very, very useful. So on your the assessment tool, you need to capture data. You need to implement the tracking, you need to collect data about what's happening on the, on your platform. And once you got, this seems obvious, but you need to do a comparisons. You need to compare the result between the control and the participant of the different versions. It might sound obvious, but in fact it's very difficult to do a, a good comparisons. It's very difficult because, uh, women breed. We do have very a lot of bases. And when we do comparisons, especially for a test, we do have a lot of different bases. Um, the selection sampling bases. So you're not really targeting, uh, correctly your users. You are making a difference between your new users and the old users. Um, you can have the time rated basis where running a AB test in September or in the middle of, um, uh, Christmas or summer holidays will have very different, uh, results. The duration basis, uh, running a AB test for today or two months can lead to very different results. The novel gba, especially if you are running a platform for years, you have customers that are here for a long time. They're, um, used to you your product. And when even if you change very small things, they will detect, even if they don't really care and they don't like it, they will detect it and, and interact with it.\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 40.59776306152344\n'normalizedScore': 0.4059776306152344\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.4059776306152344\n\n'documentId': 'uZK7nLYruT47rjfFq'\n'chunk_id': '687ad879eb1b160a4cabf458'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 5\n'total_parts': 13\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': AWS Free Tier: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\n'parentName': DevOpsCon London 2022\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2022-04-28T09:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': In recent months many experts in the AWS community have been questioning the AWS Free Tier, advocating for sandbox accounts on AWS and hard billing limits that cannot be exceeded.

So for example, if you say the 12 months of from your nice project that you try to do. I don't know a basic certification on AWS and you wanted to do it your own account and get your knife certification. And you forget that account. You never receive a bill for the first few months and then you suddenly receive that. It's been like that for broken for more than 10 years. Why should we care? Well, as I said before is number of services really going up. So it's really getting harder than harder for developers to play with it. and Almost all if you play with other Cloud providers. Well, you are not familiar with that concept. You might say what about Google? What about issue? What how do they handle it? Well, the approaches is slightly different but significantly different and really change approach. Asia is a constant of spending limits that are enabled by default. We see in a second Google has what they call a free program. So you have a fixed amount of credits whatever the number is $300, whatever but these By default you need to there are two key point is you're not charged. unless you tell them to I want to be on a paid account now so is Of course, it means that your little project or your test project or whatever might never work because at some point you've reached the level but as a developer if you're playing with it. Nothing is wrong. What about Asia Asia is a different approach but now is enabled by default on all new customer. Unfortunately just a new one. But that's that's a different topic is you can say. I really want to spend $100 a month. That's my limit. I don't want to go over $100. That's it. Nothing more nothing less. Of course. That's the other side of the problem is that if you say that if you suddenly or nice new project is going to be successful bad luck. You say that you don't want to spend more than that. So now what can we really do about that? Because it's like okay, we well first we need to know that there's but what can we do and that doesn't apply just a free here applies to any project where you want to monitor your course because the problem we say about for example Asia that you can that you can set the spending limit means as well that even on a large project. You cannot say. My maximum spending limit is $50,000 a month on AWS. You cannot say that you can control when you reach that and then react yourself. You can even create some amazing several Slumber function that turn down\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 42.90428924560547\n'normalizedScore': 0.4290428924560547\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.4290428924560547\n\n'documentId': 'uZK7nLYruT47rjfFq'\n'chunk_id': '687ad87aeb1b160a4cabf46d'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 13\n'total_parts': 13\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': AWS Free Tier: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\n'parentName': DevOpsCon London 2022\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2022-04-28T09:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': In recent months many experts in the AWS community have been questioning the AWS Free Tier, advocating for sandbox accounts on AWS and hard billing limits that cannot be exceeded.

You start to discuss about EDP or private pricing or committed amount per and then the price is the price such and may be entirely different and as well, you might not apply or in my apply in a different way. Earlier be careful eligible doesn't mean that you're not. It means that potentially that can be free. That's to me one of the most living that's part of one of the arguments big argument that was in the past was that think put yourself as a new developer that wants to try something in the console you go there you create your account and you want to create ideas. You want to create a database you start now. I don't know if they change the change is light a bit to show you the the forecasted cost. So that's that's a big step. But in the past used to be great they tell you do you want that is multi said you need multise there to if you want to me that is really yes. Do you want to have an instance that yes, you want to have provision? I hope why not you think it's free. So yes, it's actually not. There's one part that is free. All the rest is not free. So it's it's part of the no other question. All right.

Even a S3 had one storage class maximum 2 was pretty obvious to decide which one you needed to use now. I have no idea. I mean I made those numbers up. But the number of services is crazy. You might not even recognize and names. I don't recognize the name of more than half of them. And each one of them has different pricing models at different price components. So and they keep changing. They don't keep changing because they're naturally keep changing because they had new feature. They try to address what customers want and when they try to address for customer one, they they're basically adding options adding option means making it harder as a developer. I want just to play with the technology. I don't want to think too much in advance on how to play. So first of all, what is the fruit here? You have to think about like a cursor is basically a name that put at least three different major categories of things just make it quick is things that are always free. And that's usually and always free means free for any account the largest more forever. If you are creating account years ago doesn't matter. There's maybe a bit of data traffic smoothly. So whatever can be different things a bit of storage. That is free. That's great. Then there are things that are free for the 12 for 12 months. What does mean 12 months 12 months from when you created the account? That's really matter. When you created account. Yes and has to be the accounted Pace the first account. So if you create a new account as a new Project to play around and you consolidate that account in a major one. Whatever is a company one or another one that you own. That doesn't count is the account that pays where you put the credit card. and then what they call trials that usually are new product new feature that you Have for a certain amount of time can be 30 60 90 days and if 30 60 90 days not from when they call created account or when they introduce the service, but when you enable that service for the first time. So you already see that? Can mean different thing for different people. And they can change this. I'm just taking post from there official blog from the last few weeks or few months. For example, the data transfer was extended from I think used to be I don't know 10 and now is a hundred gigabyte per month. Whatever the number yeah up from one gigabyte per region now is 100 GBA gigabyte that I don't know if he's yeah per region as well.\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 42.32727813720703\n'normalizedScore': 0.4232727813720703\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.4232727813720703\n\n'documentId': 'vNHkzaWNwBNCwh9Nc'\n'chunk_id': '687b43442b0a1813a73e47ee'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 4\n'total_parts': 12\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Why Your API Doesn’t Solve My Problem: Putting Use Cases First\n'parentName': API Conference London 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-04-26T15:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': You wrote an API specification, documented your endpoints, and published SDKs.

Providers often focus on features and underlying technologies of their APIs, while failing to address the use cases their API is used for – or their assumptions don't match the reality. Developers integrating the API are frustrated, spend extra time on integration analysis, or look for another provider. Let's take a closer look at API integrations from a developers' perspective. In this session, I will show how to discover, prioritize, and present use cases for your API, how to include use cases in API design, and how to empower users to solve their problems using your API more easily.\n'parentId': 'ZPemkseFTHSENHPzK'\n'parentDescription': The Conference for Web APIs, API Design & Management\n'indexBrandName': 'APICon'\n'indexSeriesName': 'London'\n'author': 'Jan Vlnas'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': using that API in full. so now the question is what you as API providers. can do to make the integration process easier for me well one idea is to treat your API as a product. I mean like this conference, maybe you heard it from more people. And so it's nothing new for you why I'm pointing it out is that And then with a product you should have someone like a product owner or product manager for that API. And if that sounds obvious to you, that's great. But in our experience this usually not the case because many times companies just like toss out their API is something like look developers play with it. Like we don't care or they just like have like various teams having different ideas. What an API should look like so the overall experience of external developers working with apis even from a single company can be really miserable. So, The basic idea here is to have like a single person. Or maybe a team responsible for your apis. And one of the responsibilities of product owner is to understand the users and their needs so In case of apis this also includes understanding the domain of your users. What's the context in which they will use your API? in other words API product owners should understand and discover use cases of your users. And well the best place to start with that is user research. Like just ask developers who use your API or if you don't have API yet. You can maybe you have some Partners who can give you some ideas and would be interested in API. but just keep in mind when you are doing a user research that developers like talking about technical stuff and we would surely like to tell you which Technologies we like like we love graphql. Maybe we hate soap, but that's like not the point here, especially if when you are discovering those use cases. You should rather ask like what what? They are building and how they want to use your API to fulfill those use cases. You could also take a look at your competition if they have any API. um, and maybe like one obvious idea is maybe you could copy their API and like maybe that sounds ridiculous to you, but maybe you heard about this thing called from Amazon S3. Do you use it? Yeah, so S3 is my favorite example because maybe you know that there are like now many providers with their own Lobster storages like Mineo or cloudflare has this R2 and all of them implement. S3 compatible API so This is sort of like their competitive Advantage. I think like cloudflare is like the most permanent example because actually the name of their product are to is\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 43.24479293823242\n'normalizedScore': 0.43244792938232424\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.43244792938232424\n\n'documentId': 'vNHkzaWNwBNCwh9Nc'\n'chunk_id': '687b43442b0a1813a73e47f1'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 6\n'total_parts': 12\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Why Your API Doesn’t Solve My Problem: Putting Use Cases First\n'parentName': API Conference London 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-04-26T15:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': You wrote an API specification, documented your endpoints, and published SDKs.

In this session, I will show how to discover, prioritize, and present use cases for your API, how to include use cases in API design, and how to empower users to solve their problems using your API more easily.\n'parentId': 'ZPemkseFTHSENHPzK'\n'parentDescription': The Conference for Web APIs, API Design & Management\n'indexBrandName': 'APICon'\n'indexSeriesName': 'London'\n'author': 'Jan Vlnas'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': e-commerce or crypto and when I look at e-commerce solutions, for example, I can see how their products can be relevant for my particular use case. however from my experience and also I'm doing it myself like developers love to skip those marketing presentations because they are full of some fluffy marketing copay b******* basically and they usually dive straight into the documentation and what they will find there well in case of stripe, I mean like if you know something about API documentation you probably Have heard about striped recommend documentation, which is given like the permanent example of well. written and organized documentation for Developers and like there's a reason why is it so because they navigate me straight to their most popular products which is payments, but they have also other products and they like easily explain to me how Is this relevant and whether it is something I I should look at? In contrast and it's very very common. Documentation is for other providers organized like this by. their products where they treat each API or even each version of API as a separate product and With in case of here.com. They have these like when when I would like to do for example routing like navigation, they give me a heroating API here is a line routing API here Matrix routing API and hero 8.6 sequence and like just from looking at this. I have no idea which One I should use but maybe you do do you? Yeah. Another thing to include in your documentation our use case guides. As a sort of basic navigation to help developers to understand your API. So here I have example from news which is cloud-based Hospitality system for property management. And their apis honestly their API is very complex and Abstract, but they have this comprehensive documentation for common scenarios where their API is used for which explains common flows and points me to parts of the API, which are relevant just for my use case. And finally use case tutorials can be very useful for new developers. But here's the catch. As Adam Devendra from every developer points out many times documentation covers so-called product tutorials, which are focused on particular features of your API. But what we should look for are use case tutorials and Adam gives this example from twilio where they are dogs the documentation includes this appointment reminders use case you and this basically guides me like how to build airport reminder API in various languages. so but it's sort of like a rare gem among many other product focused tutorial in their documentation. It's another example from GitHub in the documentation. They have this tutorial on how to build a CI server in a ruby with our status API and webhooks and Again, this\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 42.867496490478516\n'normalizedScore': 0.4286749649047852\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.4286749649047852\n\n'documentId': 'vNHkzaWNwBNCwh9Nc'\n'chunk_id': '687b43442b0a1813a73e47ef'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 5\n'total_parts': 12\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Why Your API Doesn’t Solve My Problem: Putting Use Cases First\n'parentName': API Conference London 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-04-26T15:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': You wrote an API specification, documented your endpoints, and published SDKs. Here’s a question, though: Does your API actually solve your users’ problems? Providers often focus on features and underlying technologies of their APIs, while failing to address the use cases their API is used for – or their assumptions don't match the reality. Developers integrating the API are frustrated, spend extra time on integration analysis, or look for another provider. Let's take a closer look at API integrations from a developers' perspective.

Like it's one word and one letter and number in alphabet like better than S3. so that's A possibility it makes sense in some domains. If you have like large maybe almost like Monopoly provider and you will sort of like chip out their market share. But keep in mind that like when you are doing this, you are also taking over all the bad design decisions. They made you are also taking care of all the undercommented features. Your users will eventually rely on from the original API. So rather than copy it may be you can just take a look and think how you can improve those upon what your what Your competitors built. Maybe you can simplify determinology or maybe you can simplify some processes and flows. For example, if I need to do multiple calls to competitors API to To fulfill my use case. Maybe you could. I could do it just like with single API call in your in your case. And my favorite complementary approach is to look at the code to see how apis are actually used in the wild. So like one of the obvious place to start is GitHub and start by entering your company name or URL of your API into GitHub search and maybe you will be surprised surprised what you will find. Also Gita prepositories are organized into topics. Which can be helpful for better understanding of the domain you are trying to navigate and learn about. In some domains with multiple API providers doing the same things here. I have examples with cryptocurrency exchanges or geolocation. There are popular multi provider sdks how I like to call it which implement the same interface over various apis. So if this is relevant for your domain take a look at how these sdks are used and whether it's something you could even acknowledge because if you for example provide like the implementation for this like multi provider SDK, it could make adoption easier for your users. And speaking of usage. You can also check dependency graph for every project on GitHub. So you see actually what are the projects and even packages relying on. Particular for example SDK can be your SDK or your competitors. now ideally these few tips can help you better understand where your API can be used and Now when you have better idea, you should tell me when I'm reading your recommendation. You should show me. What are the use cases for your API. So here are the few examples how API use cases are presented. Many developer oriented companies have a section on their website called Solutions. Here's example from stripe. Where Solutions are categorized by most common groups of their users like SAS companies e-commerce\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 41.79689025878906\n'normalizedScore': 0.4179689025878906\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.4179689025878906\n\n'documentId': 'uQLGQfccCGQepkM87'\n'chunk_id': '687b42f72b0a1813a73e44e5'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 1\n'total_parts': 23\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Welcome and Opening // Keynote: (Ab)User Experience: How the Dark Side of Product and Security Can Be Used for (Ab)User Stories, (Mis)Use Cases and Threat Modelling\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-05-23T07:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': We start with a welcome and conference introduction, followed by Jeff Watkins and Lianne Potters keynote: Security can often feel like an unapproachable and mysterious part of an organisation – the department of work prevention, the department of 'nope.'

What safety nets can you put in place as a developer and what are the most common mistakes to avoid unexpected bills when experimenting with new services with the AWS Free Tier? Hi everyone. Thanks for being here. My name is Renato. And today I would like to talk to you about course optimization for from a developer point of view. Not as a company not how to manage your big. Large bill as a large corporation, but as if you already developer and want to start play on the cloud play with AWS play with some new technology. And learn the technology without possibly thinking too much about the coast now. If AWS School wipe out these entire presentation with one single change, we found one single checkbox. We see what that's a checkbox and what that change is going to be in a second. As I said, I'm a developer. I've been working with AWS technology for the last 10 11 years now, so I'm old enough. And I tend to write as well a lot. for info Cube, for example a couple of hundred pieces about AWS technology And they noticed as one the most popular one are actually the one related to how to manage your Coston AWS and how to get out of problem like the AWS right here. some misconception about that and why developer get it wrong. And first of all, let's make it clear developer. Don't make it. There's nothing wrong on the developer side. Mistakes happen and it's fine to make mistake when you try something. That's to say that's my personal account. I have of course many accounts that are related to company project comparable. That's just my personal one and I'm actually aws0 so I have enough credits from AWS. I just forget for example to apply them. So at the end of the month in my hand with yeah, well just a few dollars, but what basically forgot I forgot that I had something running that's just a minor mistake just a few dollars happens and that proves as well that if you have even many years if you have used it for a while you can happen because things change it can happen because you get lazy you can happen because well for many different reasons It happens as well to famous people. I don't know many of you know, Jeff bar, but it's basically easily WS is the main leader. advocate of AWS for the last 15\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 44.76899337768555\n'normalizedScore': 0.44768993377685545\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.44768993377685545\n\n'documentId': 'uZK7nLYruT47rjfFq'\n'chunk_id': '687ad878eb1b160a4cabf44e'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 2\n'total_parts': 13\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': AWS Free Tier: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\n'parentName': DevOpsCon London 2022\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2022-04-28T09:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': In recent months many experts in the AWS community have been questioning the AWS Free Tier, advocating for sandbox accounts on AWS and hard billing limits that cannot be exceeded.

When was that? Just well one year ago. He wrote well hopes. I created a DB cluster for testing but I was locked in my personality the Blessed account not my official one time to talk to support and use a budget. So we have one he has it probably the direct line to support so he gets his bills sorted out not a big problem, but that proves as well that it can happen to everyone. And unfortunately when it happens to developer to new developers and developers that are trying to Cloud. It might be a significant one for us actually wrote about it for us used to be a cloud Guru so very much involved with certification and development or whatever now he's worked from Google. He pointed out that in the chart that for example a developer that was really really scared about these 200 dollars charge. Now $200 charge might be nothing for a company might be nothing even for a developer in London or in Europe or whatever but us. There are many places in the hood that whereas the developer if I get charged or even if I think I will be charged $200. I will be scared. So that three years if you Google online about the free tier and unwanted charging unexpected charge, you can find 100 different pieces. So it's quite a common problem. It's been there for me years. Very popular AWS last week in AWS the newsletter and as well as a post that was from current queen is is more or less summarizing. The data is the AWS for tier really free. No. Oh my God. No, it's absolutely it's not that's extreme. But there's some truth there now. Is another example and that I would like to highlight there are some comments that are quite nasty as well. That one I had in an arteries many people think that's intentional for me AWS. Well, they are making a lot of money out of small little player that forget to turn off ec2 on their personal account. I don't share that that point of view. I mean, I don't see that as a business model for AWS. I don't really see that even just they have for to reimburse many of those charges is probably not worth the time spent so I don't think there's anything nest in the by purpose So, what's the problem? I'm lucky enough that. I started playing with AWS with Cloud technology many years ago. When well, it was pretty hard to get something wrong. I mean there were two three services if you had just to play with RDS S3 and ec2 instance.

So if the cloud providing introduce a new service that that's really one you want to try and give it to try and play with it. There's a high chance. It's not there. So either you had access to a preview that was free. or you might end up that you think you're applying credit that they're not going to be applied because well it's not called that new service is no color often if you talk to Amador to the support and you can address that. another common approach to avoid that almost even on a personal level is If you want to delete everything on AWS, you can there's not a button to say well you can close the account but usually does know what you want to do is I want to delete all the resources that have in account. There are some open source projects that do that but basically is not out of the box one simpler way is you can use organization or any way. You can create a new account that doesn't have a credit card basically is refers to a parent account kind of a parent child relation. And you're saying I create this account for this project. I use it. I throw all the resources I want to do. I do my certification. I do my new idea for this new project then I get rid of it. Ideally the account when you delete the account all the resources of that account are gone and you can create a new one creating account takes seconds. So what? You can do it with API as well. So it's it's not it's first time you need to get used one of the annoying part. You need a new email address for every account, but you can usually go around that one. So you can that now big advice if you ever end up in a situation where things go wrong. So you suddenly have few thousand dollars or fewer or even fifty dollars fifty dollars matters for you.

I assume people will be maybe joining a bit later. Anyway, thank you for coming here. So late my understand that you may be tired you you are looking for to the reception. So I hope my talk won't tie you too much. Anyway a little bit about me. I am young. I'm developer. I look at superface and we are small startup from trickle public and what we do at superface among many other things is that we integrate apis a lot and what we are learning about that process and already learned is that like the biggest problem or the like the most expensive part about integrating apis isn't like building the code itself, but it's the analysis and it's all those parts like understanding the API reading the documentation understanding how to use it how to make it with your application. So today I'm going to talk about apis from developers perspective how developers if your API and what you can do to help them based on also on our very own experience. So for the purpose of this talk, I will play a role of the clueless developer, which is something I'm very good at and I will treat you my other hands as API providers. Sorry for representing you as this neat hexagon. Regardless whether you are already. If you have some API, maybe you're planning to build one or you are just curious like what is it about like bringing apis closer to Developers? so First start let me ask you a question. Why should I use your API? I mean think about it for a bit. Maybe it's the case that your API is the only one in the world. Maybe I don't have any other choice. but usually it's more like it boils down to the fact that your API so some problem. removing or for\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 43.78790283203125\n'normalizedScore': 0.4378790283203125\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.4378790283203125\n\n'documentId': 'vNHkzaWNwBNCwh9Nc'\n'chunk_id': '687b43442b0a1813a73e47ee'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 4\n'total_parts': 12\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Why Your API Doesn’t Solve My Problem: Putting Use Cases First\n'parentName': API Conference London 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-04-26T15:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': You wrote an API specification, documented your endpoints, and published SDKs.

I mean like this conference, maybe you heard it from more people. And so it's nothing new for you why I'm pointing it out is that And then with a product you should have someone like a product owner or product manager for that API. And if that sounds obvious to you, that's great. But in our experience this usually not the case because many times companies just like toss out their API is something like look developers play with it. Like we don't care or they just like have like various teams having different ideas. What an API should look like so the overall experience of external developers working with apis even from a single company can be really miserable. So, The basic idea here is to have like a single person. Or maybe a team responsible for your apis. And one of the responsibilities of product owner is to understand the users and their needs so In case of apis this also includes understanding the domain of your users. What's the context in which they will use your API? in other words API product owners should understand and discover use cases of your users. And well the best place to start with that is user research. Like just ask developers who use your API or if you don't have API yet. You can maybe you have some Partners who can give you some ideas and would be interested in API. but just keep in mind when you are doing a user research that developers like talking about technical stuff and we would surely like to tell you which Technologies we like like we love graphql. Maybe we hate soap, but that's like not the point here, especially if when you are discovering those use cases. You should rather ask like what what? They are building and how they want to use your API to fulfill those use cases. You could also take a look at your competition if they have any API. um, and maybe like one obvious idea is maybe you could copy their API and like maybe that sounds ridiculous to you, but maybe you heard about this thing called from Amazon S3. Do you use it? Yeah, so S3 is my favorite example because maybe you know that there are like now many providers with their own Lobster storages like Mineo or cloudflare has this R2 and all of them implement. S3 compatible API so This is sort of like their competitive Advantage. I think like cloudflare is like the most permanent example because actually the name of their product are to is\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 43.24479293823242\n'normalizedScore': 0.43244792938232424\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.43244792938232424\n\n'documentId': 'uZK7nLYruT47rjfFq'\n'chunk_id': '687ad879eb1b160a4cabf458'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 5\n'total_parts': 13\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': AWS Free Tier: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\n'parentName': DevOpsCon London 2022\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2022-04-28T09:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': In recent months many experts in the AWS community have been questioning the AWS Free Tier, advocating for sandbox accounts on AWS and hard billing limits that cannot be exceeded.

So for example, if you say the 12 months of from your nice project that you try to do. I don't know a basic certification on AWS and you wanted to do it your own account and get your knife certification. And you forget that account. You never receive a bill for the first few months and then you suddenly receive that. It's been like that for broken for more than 10 years. Why should we care? Well, as I said before is number of services really going up. So it's really getting harder than harder for developers to play with it. and Almost all if you play with other Cloud providers. Well, you are not familiar with that concept. You might say what about Google? What about issue? What how do they handle it? Well, the approaches is slightly different but significantly different and really change approach. Asia is a constant of spending limits that are enabled by default. We see in a second Google has what they call a free program. So you have a fixed amount of credits whatever the number is $300, whatever but these By default you need to there are two key point is you're not charged. unless you tell them to I want to be on a paid account now so is Of course, it means that your little project or your test project or whatever might never work because at some point you've reached the level but as a developer if you're playing with it. Nothing is wrong. What about Asia Asia is a different approach but now is enabled by default on all new customer. Unfortunately just a new one. But that's that's a different topic is you can say. I really want to spend $100 a month. That's my limit. I don't want to go over $100. That's it. Nothing more nothing less. Of course. That's the other side of the problem is that if you say that if you suddenly or nice new project is going to be successful bad luck. You say that you don't want to spend more than that. So now what can we really do about that?

Providers often focus on features and underlying technologies of their APIs, while failing to address the use cases their API is used for – or their assumptions don't match the reality. Developers integrating the API are frustrated, spend extra time on integration analysis, or look for another provider. Let's take a closer look at API integrations from a developers' perspective.

In contrast and it's very very common. Documentation is for other providers organized like this by. their products where they treat each API or even each version of API as a separate product and With in case of here.com. They have these like when when I would like to do for example routing like navigation, they give me a heroating API here is a line routing API here Matrix routing API and hero 8.6 sequence and like just from looking at this. I have no idea which One I should use but maybe you do do you? Yeah. Another thing to include in your documentation our use case guides. As a sort of basic navigation to help developers to understand your API. So here I have example from news which is cloud-based Hospitality system for property management. And their apis honestly their API is very complex and Abstract, but they have this comprehensive documentation for common scenarios where their API is used for which explains common flows and points me to parts of the API, which are relevant just for my use case. And finally use case tutorials can be very useful for new developers. But here's the catch. As Adam Devendra from every developer points out many times documentation covers so-called product tutorials, which are focused on particular features of your API. But what we should look for are use case tutorials and Adam gives this example from twilio where they are dogs the documentation includes this appointment reminders use case you and this basically guides me like how to build airport reminder API in various languages. so but it's sort of like a rare gem among many other product focused tutorial in their documentation. It's another example from GitHub in the documentation.

Even a S3 had one storage class maximum 2 was pretty obvious to decide which one you needed to use now. I have no idea. I mean I made those numbers up. But the number of services is crazy. You might not even recognize and names. I don't recognize the name of more than half of them. And each one of them has different pricing models at different price components. So and they keep changing. They don't keep changing because they're naturally keep changing because they had new feature. They try to address what customers want and when they try to address for customer one, they they're basically adding options adding option means making it harder as a developer. I want just to play with the technology. I don't want to think too much in advance on how to play. So first of all, what is the fruit here? You have to think about like a cursor is basically a name that put at least three different major categories of things just make it quick is things that are always free. And that's usually and always free means free for any account the largest more forever. If you are creating account years ago doesn't matter. There's maybe a bit of data traffic smoothly. So whatever can be different things a bit of storage. That is free. That's great. Then there are things that are free for the 12 for 12 months. What does mean 12 months 12 months from when you created the account? That's really matter. When you created account. Yes and has to be the accounted Pace the first account. So if you create a new account as a new Project to play around and you consolidate that account in a major one. Whatever is a company one or another one that you own. That doesn't count is the account that pays where you put the credit card. and then what they call trials that usually are new product new feature that you Have for a certain amount of time can be 30 60 90 days and if 30 60 90 days not from when they call created account or when they introduce the service, but when you enable that service for the first time. So you already see that? Can mean different thing for different people. And they can change this. I'm just taking post from there official blog from the last few weeks or few months. For example, the data transfer was extended from I think used to be I don't know 10 and now is a hundred gigabyte per month.

Like it's one word and one letter and number in alphabet like better than S3. so that's A possibility it makes sense in some domains. If you have like large maybe almost like Monopoly provider and you will sort of like chip out their market share. But keep in mind that like when you are doing this, you are also taking over all the bad design decisions. They made you are also taking care of all the undercommented features. Your users will eventually rely on from the original API. So rather than copy it may be you can just take a look and think how you can improve those upon what your what Your competitors built. Maybe you can simplify determinology or maybe you can simplify some processes and flows. For example, if I need to do multiple calls to competitors API to To fulfill my use case. Maybe you could. I could do it just like with single API call in your in your case. And my favorite complementary approach is to look at the code to see how apis are actually used in the wild. So like one of the obvious place to start is GitHub and start by entering your company name or URL of your API into GitHub search and maybe you will be surprised surprised what you will find. Also Gita prepositories are organized into topics. Which can be helpful for better understanding of the domain you are trying to navigate and learn about. In some domains with multiple API providers doing the same things here. I have examples with cryptocurrency exchanges or geolocation. There are popular multi provider sdks how I like to call it which implement the same interface over various apis. So if this is relevant for your domain take a look at how these sdks are used and whether it's something you could even acknowledge because if you for example provide like the implementation for this like multi provider SDK, it could make adoption easier for your users. And speaking of usage. You can also check dependency graph for every project on GitHub. So you see actually what are the projects and even packages relying on. Particular for example SDK can be your SDK or your competitors. now ideally these few tips can help you better understand where your API can be used and Now when you have better idea, you should tell me when I'm reading your recommendation. You should show me. What are the use cases for your API. So here are the few examples how API use cases are presented. Many developer oriented companies have a section on their website called Solutions. Here's example from stripe.

But the reality is closer to this first human needs to build those apis. Another human or maybe the same human needs to document those in those apis. So another human can actually read the documentation. and also human needs to write the necessary glucose and this is even simplified because you have all the discovery phase sales process testing purchasing and also maintenance so What the AI assistant like the one I showed with stripe I showed is that it is basically a sort of like the mediator between the documentation and the integrator. And it can simplify things a lot. But still it's like the human asking the documentation asking that chatbot and finally interpreting that API. so here's the here's the idea. What if we? Let the computer do also the analysis and interpretation of the documentation for us. Maybe it could read the documentation create a glue code and the developer just like put it in their application and maybe even better. The generator documentation could be decoupled and if there are any future API changes, we could just regenerate a glucose without changing the application. hmm well Here's a very very rough early technical preview of how this could work. So this is something from us, which we are currently testing internally. So the idea here is that you will select an API provider in this case pipe Drive, I ask it for to get open leads. Sorry open deals and it generates this graphql interface for me. and I actually get like the full schema here with input and output. Types and when I run it, yeah, it actually works. so this is something what we are testing. Basically works but there are many rough edges. So just to share with you. Sorry. Here we go. So. It turns out that timing gpt's creativity is quite hard. So my colleague gave me this example, like where He is using GPT to actually evaluate whether the given API can be used to fulfill some particular use case. Like can we search for Star Wars characters in weather API and gpt4 set? Yes, that's possible. Because you can get whether information about Star Wars locations from that API. So yeah, it can get like a very creative. and there are more challenges with this approach like What happens for example if the documentation? Gets outdated then. what we generate doesn't really match the reality of the that API and we Are basically like again this basically we get something which isn't useful to us. so here's the final idea maybe in the end we could get rid of the documentation and eventually replace humans in machine to machine\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 41.608154296875\n'normalizedScore': 0.41608154296875\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.41608154296875\n\n'documentId': 'uZK7nLYruT47rjfFq'\n'chunk_id': '687ad87aeb1b160a4cabf46b'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 12\n'total_parts': 13\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': AWS Free Tier: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\n'parentName': DevOpsCon London 2022\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2022-04-28T09:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': In recent months many experts in the AWS community have been questioning the AWS Free Tier, advocating for sandbox accounts on AWS and hard billing limits that cannot be exceeded.

Be scared of what you're going to pay. That one you can see you can handle it set in proper budget for it. Both on your personal level if you use your own account and on the company side. Give an example. I decided to do on my spare time. I was not a project for a company to do to play around with some technology was our service V2 was the interview and Decided to present something at reinvented DWS last December and what I was doing was just some fun. There was no purpose in it. I was just proving that the database is elastic just being able to draw something that I could control. So I decided to draw the the New York City skyline. Did I have to think about? A course while I was doing it in some sense. Yes reality. No because I had enough credit for AWS to think that even if I was paying. A couple of thousand dollars to do it was was okay. I didn't end up spelling that much because actually a few dollars but when you play around the first time I got it wrong. Yes it was. The point is I shouldn't have to do that. I should be able to play with the technology without having to think about that. So yeah go out and the main point is for me is be aware of what the problem pitfalls can be and set up some protection out there. I design collection of some resources you can. Put in the slide where you can find some links and ideas, and that's it. Thank you. questions right Yes, that's I repeat the question for with online. The question is basically with AWS budget. Can I? Just track a specific account or can I almost already know for example in organization or in Consolidated building? Whatever can I track multiple account together and have a single budget? You can actually do both you can say On the part of course has to be the parent account. If you are the account that pays for all the other account. I'm simplifying here. Whatever your is the organization parent account or whatever is the one where the consolidate building is happening. You can say I create a budget for everything but all service in your account, or I can create a budget for a specific account or I can create a budget for specific service across account so I can see for example, I\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 41.602420806884766\n'normalizedScore': 0.41602420806884766\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.41602420806884766\n\n'documentId': 'uZK7nLYruT47rjfFq'\n'chunk_id': '687ad879eb1b160a4cabf467'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 10\n'total_parts': 13\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': AWS Free Tier: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\n'parentName': DevOpsCon London 2022\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2022-04-28T09:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': In recent months many experts in the AWS community have been questioning the AWS Free Tier, advocating for sandbox accounts on AWS and hard billing limits that cannot be exceeded.

Usually they're very open to that. If you explain them out, the problem is so most cases go up ask don't panic and you get the money back or as well even ask some anyone in the community AWS Builders aws0 or whatever. They usually have credits to give away or a direct access to someone who can help you. now the key message for me is is really okay to to get because one thing that I really don't like is usually we tend to blame developer as well in a large company. I've seen project where oh Daniel made 3,000 euro extra that because you sagemaker and forgot to turn it off. Well, actually I think as the company as a developer as an engineering team, if you didn't have an alarm that morning of that part is personally find that the account where the developer was playing to test new technology. Might have crazy build but my every crazy because I see a billion problem the same as a bug is I might write a bad query that doesn't use an index. I might write some Java code that blow a path and through an unexpected exception. I might do something in the cloud. I might write a terraform piece that Suddenly doesn't delete the resources that it was deleting. So the point is both as a company as a developer. I need to have protection place what the protection are. Well set alarm set the sooner you get notified as soon as you can react, so If if a company to me any developer engineering team gets that someone did something wrong. Simply by looking at the PDF of the bill the following month. To me. That's the big problem. Is they forgot to monitor the course. That's not a developer problem. So the idea is if I want to really I mean, I think really the whatever is AWS Google cloud or if you're is really amazing how you can now As a developer try new things. I mean if I think even 10 years ago, you know read more. if I wanted to play with a relational database even MySQL the more posters were I have to start, you know, my machine create a virtually virtual machine maybe was not working configure it play around and deleted and I wanted to test it from version and then I have to change the package and was taking time was hard.

Now doing is say you can flag it and say the analyzer spending pattern I think of the last six months and they adjust that level. So if you say is a hundred but if my cost is going 60 70 80 90 100. They basically adopt that threshold accordingly. Of course is it's a bit more risky, but maybe Is a bit more reasonable in production? that's an example of An account my personal account I think was yeah. Where you see that I have. these are example I was mentioning is my budget is 61. And they actually forecast that forecasted budget. So the current budget is actually 78% of my target. So I have spent $48 out of 61. But actually telling me that. The forecast is going to be over. Where is that? 617 Coming from I think is coming from the average of the last few months that I don't that account. Now I see it before there's no way to set up an account without a credit card. There are a few exception. If you're lucky enough to be part of a educational program or connect to a university or connect to any project that has access to what they call educate starter accounts. That's the only exception where you actually can create accounts with certain limits. That are basically free is the same as Google Cloud, then you cannot use them in production, but you can play around. So that's what it is. You can check it out and see if you qualify for it. Now one thing that people tend to have on AWS or medical provider credits. To make credits are one of the worst thing that they offer is kind of a drug. But if I see two big two big problem with Trace first of all is Companies and developers tend to be greedy and think too much about how much the quality is worth. So if you offer a startup I give you a hundred thousand k Sorry hundred thousand dollars in credit that expiring one year. I give you $50,000 that expired in two years 90% of the company take the first one, even if Prove that almost no one is going to raise the hundred thousand. Limit and they're going to finish the credit much earlier and usually if you're good enough to reach those level quite quickly. Usually you have other way to get money that is not using credit. So usually the first problem with credit is that they've expired date and is intentionally can they be extended? No can be a redeem in other way. No, can I Mind Bitcoins.

What you received as my I think was my personal account. Yes, I think so. No, you always take at least one day because he analyzed it cost by day. Not in the end of the month. That's a very good point. That's an email that I received. That's an example. It tells me that. Guard Duty. The daily impact was $10. I received that was under 21st of April so last week and he told me that whatever was ten dollars a month. I thought the daily impact was ten dollars if he kept going that way maybe either whatever. I think I had a $10 limit threshold. Sorry, and that was there are other two things the major one to me are Badges and alarms. now What are budgets budgets is a way to do what we say before? I want to say, I don't want to spend more than 100 dollars. Okay. I cannot achieve that on AWS to really a hard code limit that is not going to go over that spending but I can say notify me when I reach the hundred dollars. You can say when I reach the $100 a music was hundred dollars example for specific service or overall, and I can say for a specific that I've already reached it. So as for today, I don't know is they 28? I've already reached under Lawless. Please. Tell me now. Or I can say if you forecast for the current month. I'm going to reach the treasure. So for example in that usually more useful because you want to know at the beginning of the month. If you do something wrong, you don't want to figure it out at the next bill cycle one month later. So usually you want to know if it's forecasted above. and recently they introduced as well what they call out adjusting budget that basically the idea behind is one of the main project you had with budgets that have been there for quite some time now is Yeah, they're cool, but they are hard to maintain Because unless you really have quite constant costs that usually is not the case. If you use a pay as you if you if you use the cloud on demand one of the challenges always being I set my my target hundred dollars. I never receive it one month I start to receive it because I'm going over. I'm lazy. I'm not gonna change it to put 110. But and then after two three months I start to ignore it because I know actually that my costs\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 41.602420806884766\n'normalizedScore': 0.41602420806884766\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.41602420806884766\n\n'documentId': 'uZK7nLYruT47rjfFq'\n'chunk_id': '687ad879eb1b160a4cabf45c'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 6\n'total_parts': 13\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': AWS Free Tier: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\n'parentName': DevOpsCon London 2022\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2022-04-28T09:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': In recent months many experts in the AWS community have been questioning the AWS Free Tier, advocating for sandbox accounts on AWS and hard billing limits that cannot be exceeded.

Instead of sending me a notification. Key level thing or kill that project or do something you can do that you can but it's not build out of the box. So almost all a new developer or someone that might not someone that is not new familiar with the technology because there are many different projects but Is not usually the first thing you build you want to build something to see if it works for my company or my own nice project. I don't want to think too much about Oh, yeah. Well first I have to build the safety net for my project. So what can I do? Well, I can do some damage limitation first of all, and that's a general advice for any AWS projects. I need to by default full access to the course management and course visualization and all the Matrix is only for the root account as by default. You shouldn't use to you that root account means that most account don't have access to the information. I usually advocate in any person. that any developer should have full visibility on the coast because well first because usually there's no real big secret unless specific cases but second is because I tend to think that is too easy to build something that's scale in the cloud if you don't think about the course, so you really need to see the course then keep a metric on that and keep it be able to visualize that AWS offer as well some free services that help in that sense. One is quite recent just over one year old is Cola normally detection is free, but again is not enabled by default. You have to enable it. and what does he do is it's basically some machine learning and it's basically telling the the cloud provider do your best to tell me when you see some anomalies in my course, so it's like if my daily cost on specific services. Explode or change the pattern please. Tell me they notify you only you can see as well said certain limits for example, don't notify me if it's less than five dollars or whatever. Make note is mainly star not mainly it's targeted to detect spikes. So if suddenly your course goes down to zero because you change the I don't know Security Group and that's not traffic on your system and your serverless application is zero. Did not don't notify you basically the cost have to go up. They don't have to go down to to trigger that. So basically what you do you create a monitor you get alerted and you react\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 41.602420806884766\n'normalizedScore': 0.41602420806884766\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.41602420806884766\n\n'documentId': 'uZK7nLYruT47rjfFq'\n'chunk_id': '687ad879eb1b160a4cabf454'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 4\n'total_parts': 13\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': AWS Free Tier: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\n'parentName': DevOpsCon London 2022\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2022-04-28T09:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': In recent months many experts in the AWS community have been questioning the AWS Free Tier, advocating for sandbox accounts on AWS and hard billing limits that cannot be exceeded.

Well, you might still care because maybe the way you deploy your application or your personal project or your company for it depends as well on those previous limits. So maybe I I didn't use cloud from because they did the advantage to put a cloud for a layer in front in the Morningside was not that significant now that they change it and they put that the first one terabyte of traffic is free. Maybe it makes a difference for a small project. It might make a big difference. Same for RDS. For example, the T3 instance that is not even the latest one has been there for years. That's the t4g. That is the latest T is this was not available under the free here. You have to use the t2 in most region now you can use that one. Is and that's from last month? Again, just week ago now as well Neptune that never offer as a database a free. Yeah and is not something new. It's been there for quite some time now has one as well. So you have to always figure it out what is included and what is not so was the problem at the end? The problem is that when you create an account on AWS or muscle your own personal account. There's no way to say this is not a production account. Any account is from that perspective a new account is the same you can there are some limits there are some limited some are hard coded some you can change their support to move but by default you can spend thousands of pounds per month and that's fair. That's fine because Is a possibly a production account and so when you create account you put your credit card down. You might not pay upfront you pay nothing in front you pay as you go and you might be able to stay in that free part, but there's nothing stopping you to pay so. Key point is service. Do not get stopped or terminated or in any case due to money reason. I mean, it's not that if your credit card balance they're gonna stop your account at some point, but that's far too late in the future. I mean when you run something if you suddenly have traffic or if you start to if you do something wrong because wrong or if you try something and you forget there and you didn't know that you still pay a minimum capacity or whatever. You still gonna be charged for it? Because there's no way to say well when you have reached $10 a hundred dollars a month, please stop there.\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 41.602420806884766\n'normalizedScore': 0.41602420806884766\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.41602420806884766\n\n'documentId': 'vNHkzaWNwBNCwh9Nc'\n'chunk_id': '687b43442b0a1813a73e47f3'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 7\n'total_parts': 12\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Why Your API Doesn’t Solve My Problem: Putting Use Cases First\n'parentName': API Conference London 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-04-26T15:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': You wrote an API specification, documented your endpoints, and published SDKs.

They just show me the code and I can learn from it and just it to my use case. Enter the example I have is from Vonage which is twilio competitor. In that case in this example, they give me a fully working contact center code and instructions how to run it. Actually the code itself is in a separate repository. These are just instructions on how to how to get it up and running but I would say this is maybe too much because now I need to study someone else's go to understand how it all works and honestly that's like less fun and like just writing the cold right? Now how you can apply this use cases here in your API design. So here's say call it a modest proposal. But if you are building or maybe revising your API, you could start with user research and use cases Discovery. This should give you better idea of real world use cases for your API. technological decisions should come after that like what sort of API makes sense for these use cases like many developers will tell you that they hate soap for example, but like if you are navigating More like Enterprise domain banking. Maybe the soap is like given standard there. So why not use it right? Now the choice of Technology also informs how you will design your API. So if you follow the design first approach, you will create some specification. For example open API document or some schema. And this will help you actually with building and testing your implementation. But you can also use the specification to build and test these use case guides and tutorials even before you build your actual API. If you if you write a specification, right you can you can mock it. You can iterate like over the mock code and like see how much your design. fits with those use cases so to tie this up. I should probably answer the question in the title of my tile talk why your API doesn't solve my problem. Well, the answer is usually because I can't understand it. Because you show me your API. You show me it's capabilities, but is it enough? Well, typically these capabilities you are presenting to me you give me API references specification documents like open API in a better case actually and this is also covered by product tutorials these capabilities. And I like to think of these. Artifacts as a map to your API you give me some idea where I can go with your API, but I need to find my way around. now the\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 41.379844665527344\n'normalizedScore': 0.41379844665527343\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.41379844665527343\n\n'documentId': 'vNHkzaWNwBNCwh9Nc'\n'chunk_id': '687b43442b0a1813a73e47ec'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 2\n'total_parts': 12\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Why Your API Doesn’t Solve My Problem: Putting Use Cases First\n'parentName': API Conference London 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-04-26T15:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': You wrote an API specification, documented your endpoints, and published SDKs.

I mean like I don't think your API will do my laundry for example, so let's put it in more concrete terms like I will probably use your API to fulfill my applications use case. And what do I mean by use case? It's some specific scenario where your API can be useful some feature of my application where your API can help. So consider this scenario. I'm building a user registration system with stuff like login and signing up and also password reset. So that's my use case. I need to send a password reset email. and as I'm thinking about this feature, I figure out that I will need to Send it email somehow maybe I will use some oops. I will I will use some external API some API provider to do the email sending for me. So I will look for some email providers like this one. This one is called Simple email service. So I assume it should be simple. So maybe there's my use case somewhere around here. But like all they talk about is features like flexible deployment options and I think about password reset emails, really. So I will search further and maybe I will find some great and then tell me we can we can send transaction emails and what our transaction emails I ask and then on their socials page. They show me how transactional emails are used including password reset emails. So That sounds promising and they also give me some examples of those emails some template I can work with so I know that this could be the right service for me and maybe I decide to use some great for this feature. So in this maybe that's sort of like a trivial example for you, but I wanted to illustrate something deeper what's going on. when I break it down my use case is to send password reset email and I figure that what I'm looking for our transactional emails. so I'm trying to map my use case to some capability. Of the provider some some features they offer. and this is also the hard part about understanding apis like I think about my use cases in my language while you as a provider present your capabilities in your language with your terminology. And well, I'm not expert in your domain. That's why I probably use your API in the first place. so I said developer. I need to map my use cases to your capabilities and translate that terminology and data structures and understand all the flows. And that's usually the part which takes us the most time when we deal with an API. Where we don't understand the problem domain.

But it doesn’t have to be that way. In this talk, we will look at the unintended users of a product, the 'threat agents'. By engaging the security team in the product development process, we can model the dark side of use cases and user stories through threat modelling techniques. This can help demystify impenetrable security NFRs through concrete examples of how these threat agents may try to misuse your shiny new digital product. Who will benefit from this talk? Those building products/apps exposed to the web; people who want to build awareness of possible attack vector use cases (i.e. how might you be attacked); and people who need to write that down as a set of requirements to help build a DevSecOps approach in projects.\n'parentId': 'ghMPhG7rh5aHckuaC'\n'parentDescription': The Conference for PHP & Web Development\n'indexBrandName': 'InternationalPHPCon'\n'indexSeriesName': 'Berlin'\n'author': 'Sebastian Meyen,Jeff Watkins,Lianne Potter'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': partly the platform gives you access to those things.

And last but not least, you'll find in-depth video tutorials from let's say web design front and development to software architecture and backend technologies. What does it mean for you? First of all, if you're coming from a non-German speaking country, you, we ask you to go to Dev mu and register yourself, you to do the conference check-in. Same for German speakers, uh, German, France, um, um, on, on and Vicla d here you find program information here you can download your certificate after the conference and also you find, uh, your, uh, session slides right after the conference. But not only that, you can watch the conference videos afterwards because everything is being recorded here. On the one hand, we stream everything live, as I said, and stuff is also recorded. You can read all those expert articles, which are just mentioned. You take hands part take, take part in those online live workshop. And last but not least, of course, you watch the video tutorials over there. These things watch conference videos, articles, uh, uh, life workshops and, uh, video tutorials. You find them as a full stack subscriber. And that's what we called, as already said, the full stack experience on deaf for the English folks or the English speaking folks and reading folks and listening folks and on inkler for the German language people. Furthermore, uh, as a subscriber you get 25%, um, discount for additional conferences if you'd like to purchase one of those. Or maybe also for trainings, which are also offering. And last but the least, there are also some offerings for larger organizations in case you are interested. If you'd like to get more information about that, go to the booth in one of the coffee breaks and ask my gentle colleagues. They're happy to talk into you about that. Okay, last but not least, of course, dev Muu and in Vila are accessible of course through the native apps here. You find, of course, um, the program overview. You find the live streams if you want to watch it over here. And, uh, and very important, you can give your feedback to the talks you're listening to. And this is really important. Please give your feedbacks to our speakers because we are more than happy to\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 40.838619232177734\n'normalizedScore': 0.40838619232177736\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.40838619232177736\n\n'documentId': 'Nbur2qizdoK2Q6i6i'\n'chunk_id': '687a2d859bbcb45d2a11eca6'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 6\n'total_parts': 13\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Capturing Our User Journey!\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2024\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2024-05-29T09:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Improving your product and better understanding your users. That's the promise of tracking. Through a case study, we will present how at Instapro-group, we use tracking to improve our marketplace using Snowplow, an open-source event analytics platform. We will detail the different types of tracking implementations available, as well as how our infrastructure handles significant volume spikes with S3, and how we validate and enrich our data with Kinesis. However, the main focus will be on the adoption and valorization of this 'source of truth' among our teams and data engineers. We will explain how we created an event catalog and implemented a monitoring and alert system. Discover how we have leveraged this data to improve our global user experience.\n'parentId': 'Lo63ufDGJ8N626Loh'\n'parentDescription': The Conference for PHP and Web Development\n'indexBrandName': 'InternationalPHPCon'\n'indexSeriesName': 'Berlin'\n'author': 'Thomas Perez'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': even if we mention that we have 20 project team, we have actually, when our world decide more than 200, uh, running experimentation or, uh, experimentation waiting to run, uh, in, in our platform. Uh, when I talk about experimentation, basically it sound like it's a AB test. Who in the audience has already done some AB tests? Okay, nice. Uh, so let's go to the basics. Uh, how do we do, uh, experimentation AB test? Uh, first of all, you need two version. You need the control version, which is a version that you actually do. And then you need a variant, uh, the participant, the new version, the new iteration of your, your feature. Uh, then you need, uh, assignment tools. You need something that will, um, assign to your user, uh, the version that they will, uh, that will belong. And for this, uh, we created a, a library, uh, a few years ago. Uh, if you want to start doing some EB test, um, it's very fast. Don't use any database. Uh, if you want to do a quick EB test, it's really, uh, very, very useful. So on your the assessment tool, you need to capture data. You need to implement the tracking, you need to collect data about what's happening on the, on your platform. And once you got, this seems obvious, but you need to do a comparisons. You need to compare the result between the control and the participant of the different versions. It might sound obvious, but in fact it's very difficult to do a, a good comparisons. It's very difficult because, uh, women breed. We do have very a lot of bases. And when we do comparisons, especially for a test, we do have a lot of different bases. Um, the selection sampling bases. So you're not really targeting, uh, correctly your users. You are making a difference between your new users and the old users. Um, you can have the time rated basis where running a AB test in September or in the middle of, um, uh, Christmas or summer holidays will have very different, uh, results. The duration basis, uh, running a AB test for today or two months can lead to very different results. The novel gba, especially if you are running a platform for years, you have customers that are here for a long time. They're, um, used to you your product. And when even if you change very small things, they will detect, even if they don't really care and they don't like it, they will detect it and, and interact with it.\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 40.59776306152344\n'normalizedScore': 0.4059776306152344\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.4059776306152344\n\n'documentId': 'vNHkzaWNwBNCwh9Nc'\n'chunk_id': '687b43452b0a1813a73e47fb'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 11\n'total_parts': 12\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Why Your API Doesn’t Solve My Problem: Putting Use Cases First\n'parentName': API Conference London 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-04-26T15:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': You wrote an API specification, documented your endpoints, and published SDKs.

Maybe you have heard about Auto GPT and even openai they have these check GPT plug-ins, but we would like to make it cheaper morelliable and actually usable for Developers. Through what we call autonomous Integrations. So to tie this up for real this time. again I've showed you how references use cases guides and use cases tutorials can help. With adoption of your API now with these large languages models. There's also this AI documentation assistant, which I like to think of them in this analogy as sort of like turnbyter navigation because it really can help like personalize the navigation for the developers and guide them straight to what they need. But if you give developers power to build their custom use cases, they'll get to their goal much faster like with some like motorized vehicle. And where we are going maybe we don't need any navigation at all, like imagine a self-driving car for apis, but that's a topic for another time. Thank you for your attention. If you want to contact me, here's my website with all my contact information what we are building we are is at superfasted Ai, and now if you have any questions. Okay. Thank you. The documentation this is actually so in this in this experimental phase. We are scraping the public documentation. Yes. Sorry. The question was whether where we are sourcing those data for the for the online viewers. another questions Okay, I see that you are looking forward to that reception. So thank you for joining here and See you around.

You know that I yeah. so they were still things from the company. Like in general documentation. No, it's starting. yeah, well actually actually at this point like What I showed you is like an early technological demo, but so we have like like three processed documentation to the model. But yeah, I think the idea is basically like to give a public URL to the documentation and it will like scraping process it on it. So you like whatever looking and we develop apis. for other people to use in this seems interesting like if you can make it easier to you I'm just thinking exactly thinking of I mean, I mean like, you know, if you okay, so please contact me and we would play likely it's your immigration. oh, no, I mean\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 40.381797790527344\n'normalizedScore': 0.40381797790527346\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.40381797790527346\n\n'documentId': 'vNHkzaWNwBNCwh9Nc'\n'chunk_id': '687b43452b0a1813a73e47f7'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 9\n'total_parts': 12\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Why Your API Doesn’t Solve My Problem: Putting Use Cases First\n'parentName': API Conference London 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-04-26T15:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': You wrote an API specification, documented your endpoints, and published SDKs.

It tends to like came up with new things. It's sometimes very creative. So It doesn't know Breezy API well. But it saw a lot of like API documentation. So it will also hmm open job. This could be like some. Open jobs resource and point and maybe there will be like authentication right like so I will just put a better access token. Well. I mean, that isn't right. This is the actual API call you need to get. The these data they call it positions in the instead of open jobs or jobs. And there is even like a versioning prefix there is company prefix. So yeah, this this doesn't work. Maybe some and sometimes it even gives you like comically wrong answers like here. For example, I have asked about pipe graph API, which is crms like sales system, and I wanted to get open deals and it figured out the Path and and endpoint well, but it decided it the status of those deals will be one and actually tells me here in this case. We set it to the status parameter. We said it won to retrieve open deals, but you can also use status open to retrieve all open deals. So you need to actually still like verify what it gives you and really depends on the popularity of the API for if you want use check GPT this way so What is actually happening or what you can do? To use these tools for to give you like more. Precise answers and what company called companies actually do they train those models on their API documentation the sort of like refine it and give it like more up-to-date data. One permanent example is well again from stripe, which is actually a close partner of open a open Ai and they are now running a close beta on the documentation assistant. I will try the video here. Let's see if it works. So it's sort of like super smart search which will generate like here. The user asked what's the test mode and like it generated this on the Fly summary from the documentation and there are now like companies and projects forming about around this idea that maybe we could like give Developers and AI assistant trained or party on particular documentation so we can make it the API analysis analyzes and usage simpler. but I think it's sort of like a missing like all the potential we can we can get from these tools and to explain what I mean. I will do a sort of like sitreg here and take a look at this total accurate schema. Like this is sort of like our mental model of how apis work, right?

If you are following this conference remotely, you probably prefer to watch it through the desk or browser app because that is a larger screen. Uh, and here you've got the same functionality, of course, program overview, live streams and feedbacks. Last but not least, let's talk about this week right now because this is a special experience provided, as I said by the brands Dev Mu and Envigor d. We've collected 75 sessions, which is a lot over the next three days. 10 workshops yesterday and Friday. Uh, seven keynotes and all in all 71 speakers are presenting their topics and, uh, their, their, their wisdom right here at the conference, uh, for you, Right? As I said, this is a combined conference. You got the PHP conference. On the other hand, you got the webinar conference, and of course there is a shared space between the two. And I'd like to comment a little bit on that. So if you're coming more from the PHP site of the world of this conference week, yeah, of course. Uh, the IPC stands for PHP coding core technologies, software architecture, DevOps, deployment, and things like that. So that's really the technical part. On the other hand, if you look, um, to the right hand, of course, webinar stands for UX design about web design, search engine marketing, and of course the new possibilities are, let's say the, the amazing and maybe also disruptive. Um, um, um, um, um, possibilities, uh, coming through a generative ai. And, uh, in the middle you see this, this pillar, which is the shared space general rep development, which is really coming from, let's say, coding front ends. On the other hand, of course, it's about designing front ends. This is the, the area, as you all know, where things are coming together. Uh, this is also, for example, about agile product development. That kind of, how can you make an organization capable in defining, in developing, uh, really great digital products which are exciting, your customers and users, and of course, which are successfully business wise, looking at these things. I'd like really to explain that in the end, it's an integrated effort. All these disciplines in the end contribute to building great digital products, right? And of course there are total many different angles. And I'd say this is a, a long tradition of this combined conference in bringing those parties together and not only in informing, let's say PHP folks about what they want to hear and to listen\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 40.20832443237305\n'normalizedScore': 0.4020832443237305\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.4020832443237305\n\n'documentId': 'uQLGQfccCGQepkM87'\n'chunk_id': '687b42fa2b0a1813a73e44fd'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 15\n'total_parts': 23\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Welcome and Opening // Keynote: (Ab)User Experience: How the Dark Side of Product and Security Can Be Used for (Ab)User Stories, (Mis)Use Cases and Threat Modelling\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-05-23T07:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': We start with a welcome and conference introduction, followed by Jeff Watkins and Lianne Potters keynote: Security can often feel like an unapproachable and mysterious part of an organisation – the department of work prevention, the department of 'nope.'

Once you've got into the mood, another exercise is to go over your product's features and ask why it's easy to miss glaring weaknesses in the product design when you're deep in development. So step back and use the five wise deep assessment. Why does your product do that? Why is that necessary? Why did you design it that way? Just something I often ask why is it good or not and why not do it differently? Because the point this is exercise is to identify the obvious weaknesses because a hacker will notice a much faster than anybody would think. So now we've warmed at what next. One of the first first things that people think about when talking security is to talk about threat modeling. So here's another security person talking about threat modeling as an engineering technique. Threat modeling is used to identify threats, um, to identify attacks, vulnerabilities and countermeasures that you can put into place into your application. It's tends to be an engineering technique. It's to help you inform your application design and it's objectives are to reduce risks. It asks four questions. So what are we building? What could go wrong? What are we doing to defend against threats? And have we acted on each of the previous steps? You, you, again, you find 'em a associated with things like, um, stride, pastor and Octave. As I sort of mentioned before, I'm not a big fan of this type of threatt modeling. It can be really technical, it can be really intensive as a process. And we all know that as soon as security starts introducing highly technical, highly intensive processes, nobody wants to do them, not even us to be honest. And so we all try and avoid it and it just never gets done. But we recommend another way. One technique we recommend to start with is, uh, called persona non grata or png, which is easier to say. A PNG represents a typical user who behaves in unwanted or possibly nefarious ways. However, like ordinary personas, you know, for people who have done product personas and things before, um, they have goals they wish to achieve and specific actions they will take to achieve those goals. Modeling PNG can therefore help us to think about the ways in which a system might be vulnerable to abuse and use this information to specify the investigating actions. Obviously you'll develop your other user personas for the genuine user, your system, and you should probably interview them and\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 40.02546310424805\n'normalizedScore': 0.4002546310424805\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.4002546310424805\n\n'documentId': 'bxnsMt8zhSJsMp4i2'\n'chunk_id': '687acada8248193de8e387d4'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 15\n'total_parts': 21\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Making Interactions Accessible to All Users\n'parentName': International JavaScript Conference Munich\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-10-24T08:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Are your websites accessible to all users? Are all the users able to interact with your application as intended regardless of their disabilities? Accessibility often remains an afterthought, even today. I'm here to share how we can change that. In this talk, we will explore best practices for building user interactions for websites that are accessible and user-friendly for our users. Using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes, we will cover strategies for interaction from a simple button to navigation, to different form elements and custom components. After this session, the audience will understand how users can use websites in different ways. They will learn different ways to test a scenario and see practical code solutions on how to make the interactions accessible.\n'parentId': '7NiotRfruiRLgfMzp'\n'parentDescription': The Fullstack Conference for JS Development\n'indexBrandName': 'InternationalJavaScriptCon'\n'indexSeriesName': 'Munich'\n'author': 'Anuradha Kumari'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': would like to, uh, suggest you go ahead and watch some talk or maybe some blog from one of my friends, Hiday, uh, he really writes, uh, good about, um, our, yeah, popovers, he has a very good, uh, talk and, uh, uh, what do you call it? Blog about popover and dialogue. So, uh, it's, it's a complex, uh, component. Now, uh, I want to talk about a place where we can go and understand about all different kinds of interactions and accessibility of any component. So, uh, they're called aria authoring practices. Here I have model open, but they're authoring practices, right? I think I do not have that. Yeah. So why Aria think it's 1.1, 1.2. I think it's going to, yeah, thank you. Cool. So, uh, whenever we are creating something and we get, uh, we think about, okay, how can we make it accessible or we want to know if that is accessible or not, are all the interactions accessible? Accessible or not? Will all the users be able to use my component or not? We can come here and we can see all of our, uh, different, uh, elements, yeah, the patterns. So we can go ahead and check about all the different patterns and we can see if we are implementing in, in that way or not. For example, for a dialogue pattern, I have it open here. Uh, we can go ahead and check that. What are the different types of interaction that can happen? And then we go ahead and check it on our website if all the interactions are working properly or not. For example, here, it gives me all the interactions about keyboard. What happens when we tab it, what happens when we shift tab it, we escape it, and so on. And it, it's a pretty good one. It is for a model when it opens and everything in the background is blurred. So that control is the only control the user can interact with at that point in time. Now, that's one good thing is now H T M L has something called dialogue, which is pretty good, uh, and it actually covers almost everything. We can just use, uh, we can use a dialogue and we can have open properties and we can open this and it's pretty good, right? Like we can close it, open it, that that's, that's pretty good. We can have a model. And one thing, which I see here is, let's say I go here, I press enter, our model opens, and by default, the focus is inside that model.\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 39.9665412902832\n'normalizedScore': 0.39966541290283203\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.39966541290283203\n\n'documentId': 'uQLGQfccCGQepkM87'\n'chunk_id': '687b42f82b0a1813a73e44f2'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 8\n'total_parts': 23\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Welcome and Opening // Keynote: (Ab)User Experience: How the Dark Side of Product and Security Can Be Used for (Ab)User Stories, (Mis)Use Cases and Threat Modelling\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-05-23T07:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': We start with a welcome and conference introduction, followed by Jeff Watkins and Lianne Potters keynote: Security can often feel like an unapproachable and mysterious part of an organisation – the department of work prevention, the department of 'nope.'

It is about security because um, if we think about security in the sense of, um, you are being creative, be it code wise or be it design wise or be it marketing wise, and then somebody comes around the corner says, no, no, it's not working because of privacy, because of security, then we are talking about the department of no as they coin it in, uh, uh, their abstract.

This is a very interesting turn for me. Now I'm a security person and I'm being invited first. That's really odd. I'm usually at the end of this process. But thank you so much for inviting me to this conference today to actually start a conference about security that just never happens. Today we're going to talk through, uh, as discussed how to make security easier for you. And that's what I'm here to do today. So let's start with the story. So the ICO recently find a company with a breach, which began with a phishing email, which sort of exfiltrated via some unsupport software, which then led to ransomware. Taylors old of time, nothing really knew or different there. They even the breach wasn't\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 39.815452575683594\n'normalizedScore': 0.39815452575683596\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.39815452575683596\n\n'documentId': 'Nbur2qizdoK2Q6i6i'\n'chunk_id': '687a2d869bbcb45d2a11ecab'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 8\n'total_parts': 13\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Capturing Our User Journey!\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2024\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2024-05-29T09:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Improving your product and better understanding your users.

I bring some confusion in into this, um, um, process. So might sound very bad, but one, two weeks letters I can see a different trend because of our marketing services. We are doing serum cycle. We are sending emails, push notification, SMS to our customer that stop the process of buying something. And then at the end we are selling more pizza, um, than, uh, we are doing previously. My own awesome. But the long term is, yeah, I'm spamming my users, I'm bringing more confusion, I'm doing not a good, good, good, good game with them, and they start to have a bad image of my, uh, my website. So my NPS is going down, and when my NPS is going down slowly, my revenue will go down very soon. So here it's a fake example, maybe not that relevant, but you may catch the importance of having tracking on the wall user journey, uh, of our user. Um, so it's already 12 minutes that I started to talk. I'm talking about tracking, tracking event tracking everywhere, but what the hell is tracking? We, I think we may have very different, uh, opinion about what is, uh, tracking. So let's go with the definition. So traffic Track King, sorry, uh, is a sequence of events that capture a user journey. It's a temporal sequence of data. And as engineers, when we think about tracking, we see two different points. We see even definition. So it's even happening on the platform and data storage, we're gonna store them. And even if you don't do actively event tracking, you all have been exposed to tracking somewhere. Uh, and I will show you an example. So it's, um, un readable, uh, example, but it's, uh, h tt P server logs kind of an an angelics, and that's a perfect event tracking solution. Even if Logs mo, uh, propose is to monitor the LS and the performance of a system, um, it's a perfect representation of really good event. Um, while event tracking is more about understanding the behavior of our user. So let's go. Why is it a good tracking event? Good tracking event need four things. The first one is a identity of who's performing the event. Uh, for our logs, we do have the IP for users. It's somehow a way to identify them. Secondly, we need the moment. If we want to create a clear seconds of what's happening on the platform, we need the moment. Third one, we need the action. We need the action done by the our user. So in our HDP\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 39.535301208496094\n'normalizedScore': 0.39535301208496093\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.39535301208496093\n\n'documentId': 'uQLGQfccCGQepkM87'\n'chunk_id': '687b42f92b0a1813a73e44fb'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 14\n'total_parts': 23\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Welcome and Opening // Keynote: (Ab)User Experience: How the Dark Side of Product and Security Can Be Used for (Ab)User Stories, (Mis)Use Cases and Threat Modelling\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-05-23T07:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': We start with a welcome and conference introduction, followed by Jeff Watkins and Lianne Potters keynote: Security can often feel like an unapproachable and mysterious part of an organisation – the department of work prevention, the department of 'nope.' But it doesn’t have to be that way. In this talk, we will look at the unintended users of a product, the 'threat agents'. By engaging the security team in the product development process, we can model the dark side of use cases and user stories through threat modelling techniques. This can help demystify impenetrable security NFRs through concrete examples of how these threat agents may try to misuse your shiny new digital product. Who will benefit from this talk? Those building products/apps exposed to the web; people who want to build awareness of possible attack vector use cases (i.e. how might you be attacked); and people who need to write that down as a set of requirements to help build a DevSecOps approach in projects.\n'parentId': 'ghMPhG7rh5aHckuaC'\n'parentDescription': The Conference for PHP & Web Development\n'indexBrandName': 'InternationalPHPCon'\n'indexSeriesName': 'Berlin'\n'author': 'Sebastian Meyen,Jeff Watkins,Lianne Potter'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': the wall mentality. I'm sure we've all been there. It creates a gatekeeping situation where the security team have to say, hold on there. Crucially also ruins any attempt or lean agile approach by blocking work and reducing throughput. So, and this thinking does not promote any autonomy, mastery or purpose in the delivery team. And also security teams just aren't big enough in most organizations and they end up overloaded. So bring them into your team early and they can leave you with the autonomy you so desire. And also we often think that tech security should be, uh, left to the technologists. The technical elements of cybersecurity are incredibly important. After all it is cyber, but the only part of the story, by the time security concerns have reached the technologists, they may be more difficult to fix as they weren't designed in from scratch. But more than that, cybersecurity is often not very user-centric as cybersecurity is not a primary uh, user task. Nobody logs into eBay and goes, well what I wanna do is log in today and they go, no, I wanna buy something. Security is not a primary user task. And as such it can be inconvenient, implemented poorly even if it still meets all your security nfr. So if it's not up to the up to the security team and the technologies alone, who is it then? Well really I think you can guess it should be a whole team concern. Um, but we believe it should start with people like the user researchers and the user experience designers. This means we'll have to think more in terms of form and function than the actual underlying mechanisms. So now we've talked about our team and our attackers motivations. It's time to discuss some of the techniques to help us start thinking like the enemy. It's time to embrace the dark side of user experience, the abuser experience. And this forms the core of product security. There's a number of tools and techniques we've identified only a few of which will have time to go over today, including, or you can see here, I'm not gonna read them all out, but we will go over some of them. We recommend the first time that you try product security techniques to be in a workshop environment so you can actually do it face to face and it'll be more fun there as well. Anyway, so, and start warming up with icebreaker exercises to get the teams thinking like an abuser. So think of a Jordan Belfort example, exercises to team build, but to get people to put their\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 39.5340576171875\n'normalizedScore': 0.395340576171875\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.395340576171875\n\n'documentId': 'Nbur2qizdoK2Q6i6i'\n'chunk_id': '687a2d879bbcb45d2a11ecb4'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 11\n'total_parts': 13\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Capturing Our User Journey!\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2024\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2024-05-29T09:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Improving your product and better understanding your users.

Um, this is an example of, uh, how in fact is actually, uh, working. Um, actually, uh, we are something around, uh, in EP group, uh, 800 millions of events per month of tracking. Yeah. Um, so that's my represent a lot of events. Um, but we, um, don't really care about. Um, we don't have any performance issues there because our, um, main point here is about our ability to write gson in S3. And we don't have any limitation to write, uh, stuff on S3. Okay. So we are recording a kind of, a huge amount of event is great, but we don't know exactly what we're tracking. And that was one of the first mission when we created this team. Like, okay, everyone is doing some tracking in, in the, in the company, but we don't know exactly what we have. So we did some monitoring, okay, we want to see exactly how much people are pushing data to, to our data warehouse. We created a tool for this. And, um, it was really helpful to, uh, detect that data issue. Um, it really help us to reduce the amount, like for example, um, if we were able to, um, really catch up that, um, a volume of, uh, customer registration event, for example, really go is, is really going down, uh, and to, um, take some action quickly. So for this, we are, uh, added some, uh, alarms and we have some, uh, slack notifications that will help us to, uh, ally the fact that things are going down. And we also wanted to, um, um, have an event catalog. So our event catalog is, um, a way to, uh, understand exactly what is, uh, in our data warehouse, what kind of different event do we have, how do, since when do they exist, uh, do we still push this kind of, uh, event? Do we use them? And, uh, yeah, knowing what is in data warehouse is much more better. So we, we benchmark different tools. And finally we came with a solution where we, we created our own, uh, uh, Google sheet, which is, uh, updated, uh, daily with new, new, uh, new event. And that was really a game changer for our team because we were knowing exactly what's happening, uh, what kind of, uh, events the team were implemented. Uh, we were able to, um, um, highlight the fact that some engineers were using a category where they only have one\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 39.51133346557617\n'normalizedScore': 0.3951133346557617\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.3951133346557617\n\n'documentId': 'bxnsMt8zhSJsMp4i2'\n'chunk_id': '687acad88248193de8e387c3'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 1\n'total_parts': 21\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Making Interactions Accessible to All Users\n'parentName': International JavaScript Conference Munich\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-10-24T08:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Are your websites accessible to all users?

Uh, so I'm talking about a topic making interactions accessible to all our users. Uh, the agenda for today is introduction about accessibility and interaction. Then we will see how our users interact with Web and how can we make it accessible for all our users. Uh, this was the introduction about me. I will just make it quickly. Uh, I'm a senior front-end developer, and, uh, yeah, you can connect with me on LinkedIn at ADA 15 or on Twitter at Miracle 4 0 4. Maybe that's the camera. Yeah. So, uh, let's see. First, what is interaction? Interaction is, uh, a contact between user and the web interface, like any website or application, how users contact it, how users may perform some action. And then there is some response from our interface. So this can be termed as interaction. And, uh, how do users interact with web? So, uh, I already asked the room, uh, so I will just go ahead with solutions. So like, uh, some common ways in which we think that users interact with web, uh, are click, we can click, we can type, we can hover, uh, we can scroll, we can these things, right? And these ways users commonly interact with web. Now, accessibility. So what is accessibility? So accessibility means making resources and services usable by everyone regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Disabilities. And why is it important? So, uh, accessibility is important because whatever we are building, we are building for our users, right? And our users can be very diverse. They can have different types of disabilities, and since, uh, there are diverse user, they can have different types of disabilities. Hence, there are different types of assistive technologies which users use to interact with Web. So, uh, apart from just Mouse, right? So apart from just Mouse,\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 39.47296905517578\n'normalizedScore': 0.39472969055175783\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.39472969055175783\n\n'documentId': 'Nbur2qizdoK2Q6i6i'\n'chunk_id': '687a2d869bbcb45d2a11ecae'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 9\n'total_parts': 13\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Capturing Our User Journey!\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2024\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2024-05-29T09:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Improving your product and better understanding your users.

If we want to create a clear seconds of what's happening on the platform, we need the moment. Third one, we need the action. We need the action done by the our user. So in our HDP log, it will be like, get robot ta and then we need more context, we need to add more data, we need to enrich more of this. And in our log, it will be, for example, the user agent. It will be the length of the response, it will be the HTP code. Uh, it's more context. Okay? Um, so that might sound very, um, not really relevant to this kind of event. So let's see, a real world event. Uh, for example, it's kind of formatted as the G and we can see that we have all the marker. We do have the categories, the action performed timestamp. So the moment, a way to identify the users session id. And we do have, um, a list of context. Okay, so now that we have this kind of event, what, how do we track really how do we use, now we have know how to do good event, how do we use it? Uh, so there is different way to do tracking. Mostly two of them are, are a big one. Uh, behavioral tracking. It means that we track how the user react with the platform, how they click slide, uh, interact with yeah, the UI itself. And at the second time we do have domain tracking. And there it will be more about, uh, the action really performed by the user concrete action. Um, let's imagine that, um, as a customer, I will submit a review, uh, for a project, um, in term of bare tracking, I will track the fact that the user, uh, enter some text in the, in the textile area and click on the button to submit it. While on the domain tracking, I will catch an event that will say, okay, this user posted the review, but maybe it was this, um, it did already a lot of review and this new review, um, Halim to become one of our top review of our customer. It's something that is not related to what the user perform as an action, but it's something related to how our business is working. Okay. Um, but now that we know how to do events, the different kind of event, how do we implement this? Uh, so here's a representation of, uh, how we handle with event in our, in our platform. Uh, so mainly we have two, uh, way to do this.

So I want to monitor who gives a star to my project. And I want to know that on GitHub and gitlab. So I will look into the documentation for each of these platforms. So let's start with GitHub. I learned that each repository has something called stargazers, which is how GitHub actually calls people who give a start to the Repository. and now I understand the concepts and I can translate and for my own needs for my use case. And I also need to figure out which I will use the rest or graphql API and then I can translate my use case to that particular API. Now, let's take a look at gitlab while gitlab has a concept of Repository. It's something different than githubs in case of gitlab day call IT projects. And instead of stargazers they have something called starters. So I really need to understand these differences and sort of like ironically like the prior and prior knowledge of GitHub. API can be sort of misleading here. And again, which is sort of nice coincidence even gitlab offers both about rest and graphql API. So again, I need to decide which one I will use and I should rather hope that both of these apis provide even the same features like This isn't always the case and sometimes these interfaces sort of drift apart. So let's developers. We have to do a lot of mapping when integrating an API. We need to understand the concepts and the domain of the API and then we need to actually translate our use case to those specific API calls. And beside that we need to also understand business business rules, like things like rate limits or how is pricing structured or what authentication Scopes. I need actually like how does the authentication works or how API changes are announced and handled like what happens if there are some API deprecations. Will you break my app? So for me as a developer, there's a lot of stuff to cover when I'm integrating an API. and just to break it down. I need to understand the problem domain of your API was a terminology. What are the processes? I need to understand the business rules. Of your API to know what happens as my usage increases and what's the impact on long term maintenance? And I also need to figure out what your API offers features and capabilities and which are relevant to me. and finally when I get all of that ideally. I can map my use case to your API and actually start using\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 39.38231658935547\n'normalizedScore': 0.3938231658935547\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.3938231658935547\n\n'documentId': 'vNHkzaWNwBNCwh9Nc'\n'chunk_id': '687b43452b0a1813a73e47fc'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 12\n'total_parts': 12\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Why Your API Doesn’t Solve My Problem: Putting Use Cases First\n'parentName': API Conference London 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-04-26T15:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': You wrote an API specification, documented your endpoints, and published SDKs.

And what's important here these? Free categories they are not meant to replace each other. They Are complementing each other? so use case tutorials are great for getting to know your API to understand your problem domain and like it to sort of gather the terminology and as I become like more experience with your API, I can just like look at the reference when I need some new feature and I don't need maybe I don't need those use case tutorials anymore. but still it's something which really helps with that initial. First step to adopting the API. so this is what was in the scope of talk. originally But I wanted to address recent developments from the last few months. So here's one more thing and let's address the elephant in the room. And those are large language models. So especially openai's GPT So let me ask you a question who here didn't try to GPT. Okay, and I have one more question for those who didn't try his hand who of you use it like regularly say part of your work at least like say once a week once a month. anyone Maybe even more often. Yeah, like like in any capacity like if you like make it part of your workflow. Just two of you interesting. Maybe I'm even laser than I thought. so but I don't want to talk here about like how GPT is a revolutionary and it will change like all the work read us and it will take our Jabs but I want to focus on apis. So if you remember that example, I get I gave you with GitHub stargazers. Should GPT even like the gpt3 which is like the older less capable model. It can actually give me like a fully working code when I when I ask it for my use case and this is this is pretty nice.

It's costly, it's boring and it's no fun. So let's move away from clunky NFR to thinking about something that we're all kind of comfortable with, something more human, more familiar. And this is a standard user story. So we can take this standard user story and flip it to the dog side. So as a cyber security criminal, I want to steal credit card information so that I can make fraudulent charges. Now this changes that which was the same security NFR before into something much more readable. But not only that, it also enables you to be able to think what can you achieve from this? It opens you out a lot more instead of saying how can you do this within the uh, PCI DSS framework, how can you achieve this more creatively? And with this, just like any other standard user story, you want to also have an acceptance criteria as well, which is a key element of it. So my recommendation to you, and it's something I've done um, in every organization I've worked in as a security person, is to do a workshop on refining your security nfs, get all together and start going through the huge spreadsheet, which I'm sure there's just loads of them on there and start saying how can we change these into abuse cases? Because then you'll find actually you can just pick up that abuse case and put it on your backlog like you would normally. And it won't just sit there like a traditional security in a hour. It'll be more digestible and it'll give you more autonomy to solve problems your way. Hopefully we've convinced you that thinking like the bad guys is a fun way to problem solve. And we all love to solve problems in this industry. I mean that's why I joined the industry. And which brings us back to threat modeling, which is one of the most important aspects of cybersecurity. However, it's often overcomplicated the methods can be time consuming, require a lot of expertise and this complexity distracts really from what we want to achieve with threat modeling. And it's just the process of asking a few simple questions of any system you're trying to build or extend. What is the system and who cares about it, what does it need to do? What bad things can happen to it through attack or um, accident? What must be true about the systems, it can still do what it needs to do even when it's under attack. And we kind of played a trick with these, some of these techniques, um, these alternatives to Pastor Strat Octa,\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 39.281471252441406\n'normalizedScore': 0.3928147125244141\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.3928147125244141\n\n'documentId': 'uQLGQfccCGQepkM87'\n'chunk_id': '687b42fa2b0a1813a73e4507'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 23\n'total_parts': 23\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Welcome and Opening // Keynote: (Ab)User Experience: How the Dark Side of Product and Security Can Be Used for (Ab)User Stories, (Mis)Use Cases and Threat Modelling\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-05-23T07:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': We start with a welcome and conference introduction, followed by Jeff Watkins and Lianne Potters keynote: Security can often feel like an unapproachable and mysterious part of an organisation – the department of work prevention, the department of 'nope.'

It's not about being an engineer. It's not about being technologist. It's also not really about being a a hacker or a goodie. It's about embracing all those sides because the paths that lead us this way will always be happy paths. Hackers are using what makes us human against us. This talk has been about how we use what makes them hackers against them. Because when you follow the cables, every piece of that um, journey has connected to a person, to a consumer, um, a technologist and even a hacker. And we should never lose sight of this. And I really encourage you to carry on falling around and finding out. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Leanne Potter and Jeff Watkins. And uh, I think it's really great to look at security as an integral aspect of product design, right? And I really like the idea of also not focusing just on the user, but focusing also on the app user. So security is kind of a design process, what I learned here. Indeed. Thank you so much. Thank you. Now, yeah, pick applause. Thank you. Now enjoy, please enjoy the conference.

So yes, title can also be one of the ways in which we can make it accessible other. Sure. Um, okay, I forgot to, uh, repeat your last question. So the question was, uh, what do we think about using title for the buttons, which are icon only? So that's what I give the answer for. And the second question is about testing, uh, for accessibility, right? Uh, using manual or something else. So yeah, so, uh, I actually have a whole talk about it, but uh, manual testing is very important, even if there they're automated testing. So I do, uh, uh, recommend testing manually. So the most simple one would be using keyboard, but then we can go ahead and also test using our screen readers because screener testing is also important because there are many users who use that. So at least, um, uh, keyboard testing and screen reader testing. Uh, apart from that, uh, I think there should be user testing. So like, uh, uh, there are certain, uh, companies which do provide, uh, user testing as well, where, uh, disabled users, like they test it and they let us know about, uh, if the experience is accessible or not. And I think it's very important because, uh, the people who really are using it in um, different, using different assistive technologies, they can provide us the best feedback of how they really use it, right? Uh, apart from that, yes, automated testing can also be used, uh, with caution because automated test does not cover all of the different scenarios. They only cover maybe 30, 40%, maybe a bit more, but yeah, uh, but using automated tests, there are ways in which we can use some tools. Uh, if as a developer we can use even some dev tools as well. In dev tools, uh, one thing is, uh, one tool is very, uh, good is ax, so anything by DQ is actually good. So there are AX tools, uh, even in dev tools when we use Chrome and we are using Lighthouse, they also use ax. Uh, apart from that, there is something specifically called AX dev tools. If we install it, they also provide a good summary of all the errors and they provide much more information. So I really like using apps, dev tools. There is tool by Microsoft called Insights, Microsoft Insights, exhibit insights for web.

So this is where I got the functions uploaded to the platform and this is all available in the CLI again. So you can code it with your idea of choice. So then once I've changed the function and this uses a basic encrypt decryption Library, so it just MPN run upload and wait a bit and then it's successfully just uploads that to that project up in my portal. So that's the first one and then here comes the second one. So as you can see, it's been updated. So now I'm going to run my application again. just call a new function. And then it's now telling me. That the code hash did not match the hash provided by the color. So now it's telling me this is not a trusted Enclave. So What I can do here or what I can offer my user as a developer is either say do you still accept these terms so like with the padlock we have for transport layer security. It'll give you a warning if there's no padlock there and telling you the side is on trusted and use the user can decide whether you don't care and you just going to continue or if you decide yeah, I'm going to not go into this so you can do the same with applications that are running with confidential Computing. If you're being told something's wrong. It doesn't match what you've expected use a user can decide. Okay? Yeah. I'm going to leave this or just continue on with it, but we're giving that That choice to the user now. And it protects the user's data. It protects us if we were hacked. So everyone's happy. So here's the code it's so. Seamless to integrate into your applications and we also have a Java SDK. So this is using our JavaScript SDK. So in my react application, I just create. and the conclave SDK object and then I just call it in my functions like so I just imported in college and then me using confidential computing So, thank you. Yep, so that's pretty much that's it. That's it. I'll talk and there's not obviously much time left for the two-day conference.

Like, let's go ahead and again, voiceover start, start voiceover. Uh, and I have just simulated an error. This is not a real error, but I just made some error, uh, but just to simulate what it is. And okay, so I'm pressing enter. Let's say some server errors comes back. Right now the server error has come back and there's some error. It says that there is a error submitting form. Please fix the issue and try again. Now, if we watch, there is no notification from the voiceover about this error, this is a feedback, this is a dynamic feedback coming in, we can see it. So now we are seeing that there is an error on the screen, but for someone who is only reliant on the screen reader, how would they know the feedback? How would they know if it was success or if it was a failure in submitting of my form, right? So for that, there is something called live reasons. So, uh, we have live reasons and how we can make any dev live reason, uh, is we have to say the role, uh, there are different values of role and Aria life. I'm using polite. So, uh, there are, the other one is alert for role. So what happens is when there's a alert, it's like even if it's screen reader was a announcing something to our user, it'll stop that announcement and announce this message because this is the top priority. So, uh, in most of the cases, I think we will have to use polite. So what polite does is that it waits for that announcement to finish, and once that is finished, it announces this message. So it's like, okay, let them finish. And then I talk, uh, when we will use the alert or the other one, assertive is when, uh, let's a very urgent kind of situation. For example, let's say that, uh, there is a fire in the building, you want to evacuate like right now. So that's like you said, okay, evacuate right now, stop everything else. So it's like that. So, uh, and one very important, uh, thing about here is that whatever reason we are making live, that has to be in dorm from before, like, uh, uh, you should not be creating this diff dynamically and then adding these roles. No, the diff should be there in the dorm and we can just add or remove the messages. Otherwise, the live reason is not going to work properly. So now we have done it live, uh,\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 39.165687561035156\n'normalizedScore': 0.39165687561035156\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.39165687561035156\n\n'documentId': 'uQLGQfccCGQepkM87'\n'chunk_id': '687b42f82b0a1813a73e44f1'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 7\n'total_parts': 23\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Welcome and Opening // Keynote: (Ab)User Experience: How the Dark Side of Product and Security Can Be Used for (Ab)User Stories, (Mis)Use Cases and Threat Modelling\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-05-23T07:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': We start with a welcome and conference introduction, followed by Jeff Watkins and Lianne Potters keynote: Security can often feel like an unapproachable and mysterious part of an organisation – the department of work prevention, the department of 'nope.'

These things really matter. And Matina Miz, one of the advisors of this conference, uh, she is going to talk about, let's say the psychological aspects of how to innovate, how to continually innovate, and what are the conditions about innovation in organization. So don't miss this keynote as well. Tomorrow we are going to have another keynote about advancements in robotics in and ai. Um, our keynote speaker is an expert in, uh, uh, especially in robotics. And we, she will show some example what kind of amazing things are happening, uh, uh, uh, in that kind of research. On the one hand, on the other hand, she will also show some scary things and she will also raise some questions. So it's going to be also in a very interesting keynote for all of us, looking a little bit to the present and future of those technologies we are talking about here. And, uh, also tomorrow around lunchtime, um, we got a keynote by Yo Gaja. And I remember we initially asked him to, um, to do keynote about what he thinks about the metaverse. But, uh, guess what, something happened. Nobody's talking about the metaverse anymore because some, something different happened in between. But, um, he's somebody who really cares about the idea of how could we preserve the basic idea of the web. The web as a huge space for creativity, a huge space for everybody can contribute something, a huge space for everybody's business. And, uh, this huge space shouldn't be owned by only some organizations. And uh, as you probably remember, uh, all those conversations about the metaverse kind of led to the fact that some big players tried to own the thing or own larger parts of the thing. And we should really think about, okay, what is the future of the weapon? What kind of weapon do we like to see? Gerta is talking about that tomorrow to all of us last, but at least, uh, on Thursday there's another keynote about advancing your design practice.

Either by the user themselves or through like a legal third party. But then this is signed with a cryptographic hash over the code itself. So this means that the code cannot be changed once it has been. Signed and this audit report can be something like an applications permissions whenever you're downloading a smartphone application something like that and then by accepting that report. the user knows exactly what's the what the code is going to do with their data that's going to be processed and they also wear that it cannot be changed otherwise a signature of that and cryptographic hash changes and then it fails So the developer then encrypts and uploads the JavaScript code into the service. And then same as before the user invokes the function that has been uploaded to the service. However, in this case the user encrypts not only the data being passed. To the function, but also the signature of the function that they trust the process to use their data. And again same as before the service will cue the invocation and it will start container for the JavaScript engine to execute in. However, in this instance the JavaScript engine runs inside an international Enclave. And when the code and the user data did the encryption they used a public key where the private key can only be accessed inside this Enclave. and so the JavaScript Enclave will decrypt the code and prepare it. Will then decrypt the user data and the signature. And it's a signature provided by the user does not match. What The Enclave has it will be aborted the invocation is finished. So this provides code Integrity for the JavaScript code and ensures the user knows exactly what code executes over their data. so if that doesn't match an area's return all the way back to the user and it's coming directly from the enclave and the user will know why it was something was changed that they did not agree to and then how do we know the JavaScript engine is the only entity with access to the keys to access the code in the data? For us intellects GX provides a capability that allows end users to verify an attestation from The Enclave that shows that The Enclave is running in a valid intelligence trusted environment. So within conclave Cloud we provide a route of trust Enclave which we call the KDs the key derivation service The user verifies the attestation for just this enclave and it needs to verify it. And then once it's verified that it's a valid KDs Enclave, it will trust that Enclave to distribute private keys to other valid enclaves within the platform for us. This will be the JavaScript Enclave.\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 38.751033782958984\n'normalizedScore': 0.3875103378295898\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.3875103378295898\n\n'documentId': 'bxnsMt8zhSJsMp4i2'\n'chunk_id': '687acad88248193de8e387c8'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 6\n'total_parts': 21\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Making Interactions Accessible to All Users\n'parentName': International JavaScript Conference Munich\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-10-24T08:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Are your websites accessible to all users?

Now, there are other ways to do it. Like instead of this, I could say Aria label and put a text on it. So if I say Aria label, it still works. So Aria label equal to, let's say, favorite, right? Favorite. So it works, but the problem is that sometimes with internationalization, something happened, oh, maybe like this, uh, shouldn't I did, okay. Ah, okay, maybe, oh my God. Anyways, so we can, uh, I think the area works like that, but yeah, uh, so with Aria label, I can still do it, but the problem is that when we are doing any sort of internet, it's the comment, I guess I think I did something with the comment, but yeah. So, uh, anyways, I'll figure it out. But with Aria label, so if there is some internationalization, right? Like if the user is converting it, some other language that might pose issues for the user. So, uh, that's why, uh, if you are targeting users, which might, uh, mean in different language and they are still going to be using your website, then this is another approach. Or you can use something called Aria labeled by. But then again, that text will be visible. So what we want here is we want something where the text is not shown, but still it's in the dorm, so the user can, uh, still hear it. So this is one of the ways, uh, and when we do it, I really don't know what happened, but I'll just do control Z To Maybe just a usable error because this still showing some error with, okay, yeah, refresh it. But anyways, yeah. So now, uh, this should, now, if I start this voiceover Now mm-hmm. Just give me a moment happened. Is this okay, cool. Yeah. Okay, So I'm using voiceover and here it says favorite button group. So now it'll, uh, announce the name and we know that what this button is and what it does, which is a good user experience. Now, another thing is that, uh, there could be some ways in which, uh, some of our controls have some state, right? Like, uh, here it has some state, it's getting favorited and it is getting un favorited. Now, for normal, this scenario, I would maybe use a radio button or a checkbox that could work and we could style it, but I'm showing an example for places where maybe we are not using checkbox or a radio button, but we have some other kind of\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 38.71749496459961\n'normalizedScore': 0.3871749496459961\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.3871749496459961\n\n'documentId': 'uQLGQfccCGQepkM87'\n'chunk_id': '687b42f82b0a1813a73e44f4'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 10\n'total_parts': 23\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Welcome and Opening // Keynote: (Ab)User Experience: How the Dark Side of Product and Security Can Be Used for (Ab)User Stories, (Mis)Use Cases and Threat Modelling\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-05-23T07:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': We start with a welcome and conference introduction, followed by Jeff Watkins and Lianne Potters keynote: Security can often feel like an unapproachable and mysterious part of an organisation – the department of work prevention, the department of 'nope.'

And it starts with thinking holistically because it's all about perception when it comes to security. We need to stop thinking of security as security's problem, even by calling it a problem. You're kind of mentally framing it and categorizing it as a burden. A problem is unwelcome. A problem is difficult. A problem is something you avoid and you hope someone else will fix. We avoid problems and engage in much easier tasks cuz that's just the way we're hardwired. But we need to get out of this mindset because good security is a real opportunity to add value to our products and to our customers. And I think a gold standard in security shouldn't mean a compromise on quality and it shouldn't mean pitching one over the other. We need to get out this mindset. We need to think like the enemy because the cyber, um, criminals are using what makes us human against us. They're becoming evermore sophisticated, evermore nuanced, and they're leveraging the knowledge that they have about us to their benefit. They know that you don't get on with the security team. They know that you do workarounds from the security controls and they leverage that and they play upon our inability to effectively collaborate together. We need to fight fire with fire because as I said, the security tools will only get us so far. So for this conference, we're gonna show you how you can leverage your best defense, your people. Cybersecurity criminals don't think like we do. They have a set of different set of objectives to us in order towar the attacks that they're having on us. We need to emulate them, we need to think like them and see what makes them so successful at what they do. And we're calling it the fool around and find out mentality, it was gonna be enough ref word, but we fought for this time of morning. We're not going to say that The cyber security's ability, criminal's ability to be able to flip that user journey into the unhappy path is what really makes them successful. And in order to do this, we need to start thinking about how can even the most well-resourced security teams in the world and you're thinking about your Microsofts and things like that, how can they be taken down so easily? Well, we're gonna fool around and find out today and think like a hacker and make sense of what we're\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 38.64491271972656\n'normalizedScore': 0.38644912719726565\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.38644912719726565\n\n'documentId': 'uQLGQfccCGQepkM87'\n'chunk_id': '687b42f82b0a1813a73e44f7'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 12\n'total_parts': 23\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Welcome and Opening // Keynote: (Ab)User Experience: How the Dark Side of Product and Security Can Be Used for (Ab)User Stories, (Mis)Use Cases and Threat Modelling\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-05-23T07:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': We start with a welcome and conference introduction, followed by Jeff Watkins and Lianne Potters keynote: Security can often feel like an unapproachable and mysterious part of an organisation – the department of work prevention, the department of 'nope.'

What first of all is the actual security of a physical product such as a phone or a laptop, and then the security of a digital product. And we're talking about the latter today. Um, but how is product security different from application security? Let's compare the security within, uh, a product team and the AppSec team in a larger tech company. And the core, um, component of most established cybersecurity teams is a good AppSec program which Leanne helps run as well, uh, her employer. Um, it ensures that IT applications are developed to a high standard. Um, vulnerabilities are identified and addressed as arises and they will spec, usually specify a secure software delivery lifecycle. They'll put the tooling in. It's all pretty technical stuff and the AppSec team will usually report to the ESO on the other side, the application at the uh, product security team. Um, they'll focus more on designing security into products and will usually report to the cto. Um, the security experts within the product team will be engaged every single stage of the product process. They're less concerned with things like network security, security tooling, internal security policies. And also crucially, we believe that thinking product security terms better enables us to understand the abuser experience. So the abuser experience, what is it? Well, it's kind like an evil version of the user experience. It's um, the kind of anti-us. And to find the abuser experience, we start thinking about who are our abusers, you know, why might they attack us? You know, how can that be expressed in the context of something like fret modeling, for example. So you're talking like strive, pastora and octave, but contrary to what you might think, the who really, unless, unless in your touch job title is security researcher, the who's not really that important because the who will only get you so far. You know, it doesn't really matter if it's an individual hacker or if it's a big nation state or advanced, um, threat. That doesn't really matter if you're just building something, um, because it's really about how are you going to use what you know about how people get in, not not why all the motives to protect your products and services. So when you are truly thinking about what you need to do, you need to start thinking about the design process in terms of the abusers, um, the the abuser story version. So getting into that mindset, you need to start thinking in an adversarial way. So attackers, as I was\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 38.611209869384766\n'normalizedScore': 0.38611209869384766\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.38611209869384766\n\n'documentId': 'uQLGQfccCGQepkM87'\n'chunk_id': '687b42fa2b0a1813a73e4502'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 19\n'total_parts': 23\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Welcome and Opening // Keynote: (Ab)User Experience: How the Dark Side of Product and Security Can Be Used for (Ab)User Stories, (Mis)Use Cases and Threat Modelling\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-05-23T07:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': We start with a welcome and conference introduction, followed by Jeff Watkins and Lianne Potters keynote: Security can often feel like an unapproachable and mysterious part of an organisation – the department of work prevention, the department of 'nope.'

They're actually quite a lot of them. So what's the whole so well about this set of exercises? These exercises all work well together off the back of them. You'll have your owners and threat agents through PNG assets, threats through misuse cases, abuser stories. They'll have, they'll show some of the vulnerabilities, some of the countermeasures. And you can do all this more tech technical threat modeling later. But this completely supports it. And the reason we should do it is because it's progressive. It divides and conquers and it keeps you focused on thinking at a single conceptual level for each exercise. It's breaking down threat modeling into its constituent parts and making it accessible for the whole team. Evaluating the various threat modeling techniques is found that Octa and pastor both considered difficult to learn and to use. And that's for people who are experts. Um, stride was intermediate for both, whereas things like PNG and misuse cases considered both easy to learn and use for people even non-technical. So we've done some threat modeling through different means. Now what we need to put in our agile delivery lifecycle, this should obviously include thinking about things like a secure software delivery lifecycle, DevSecOps, tooling, um, but from a product security point of view, we can think in lean agile ways to implement as efficiently as possible. Cause early is cheaper, major security needs are identified already in requirements decomposition, it avoids bottlenecks cuz decision and risk approval is done locally. It reduces variability cuz threat analysis is business as usual. Security is addressed one line at a ti once story at a time. So you can be doing small batches and the rapid figure out means we can do risk acceptance at the product owner level rather than going to another team. And it's decentralized that every team can, product owner can do it. And this scales naturally with no single point of failure, no squeezed security team looking stressed and saying no. But when it comes to writing your security user stories, our research has shown there is no common agree on what good looks like. However, we would recommend describing requirements that focus on what should be achieved, not necessarily how we can leave that to the NFR Anthropologists. How on now building a security culture is really important and in order to successfully apply the tools and techniques we've discussed so far, you're gonna need to build it. And while the most effective way to build a good security culture is through top-down\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 38.611209869384766\n'normalizedScore': 0.38611209869384766\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.38611209869384766\n\n'documentId': 'uQLGQfccCGQepkM87'\n'chunk_id': '687b42fa2b0a1813a73e44ff'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 16\n'total_parts': 23\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Welcome and Opening // Keynote: (Ab)User Experience: How the Dark Side of Product and Security Can Be Used for (Ab)User Stories, (Mis)Use Cases and Threat Modelling\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-05-23T07:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': We start with a welcome and conference introduction, followed by Jeff Watkins and Lianne Potters keynote: Security can often feel like an unapproachable and mysterious part of an organisation – the department of work prevention, the department of 'nope.'

But it's a bit more difficult to interview your person and grata, they're not really going to make themselves available for interviews and give you the answers they want if they want to hack your system. Um, however, this approach, if you get into that role play element of it, makes threat modeling more tractable by asking the team to focus on the attackers their motivations and their abilities. This can sound redundant if you're doing other threat modeling such as Stride. However, Carnegie Mellon University did a study and found that PNG analysis performed consistently well across all teams, even in teams where there's much poorer performance using Stride. So this in our opinion, is a good entry point into product security activities. You see there, we've got like a little card, we identify the persona, what they're trying to get out of it, little bit of backstory and the actual skills they use. This is a good way of kind of starting, starting with um, this and the next technique is misuse cases. Um, now I'm sure many of you use a good old-fashioned use case hands up who's done an old-fashioned u l use case, oh God, a few of than I thought. Um, these are the expected good use cases, but based on what we've done so far, now we can start to map our persona and on grata our abusers to what parts of the product they'll attack and how. So here we go. We've got customer and employee and there's got a number of different actions you'd take. We can do this, um, with misuse cases, which are the inverse of a regular use case and describe the process of ex um, executing malicious acts against system. Typically you put them on the same diagram like this. So here's here's our malicious hacker cyber th from disgruntled CU customer. There's the things they'd like to, and this you can see comes from the personnel, you can take the goals. Um, so I think these is a good thing. It allows equal weightage for functional non-functional requirements, but it also allows you to visualize them without going into the abstract world of security. Non-functional requirements, they emphasize security from the beginning of the design process and help avoid hasty design decisions. They're actually quite visual as well. So they cross the barrier between technical and non-technical quite well. And creating misuse cases often creates a chain reaction which eases the identification of these requirements. Discovery of a misuse case\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 38.611209869384766\n'normalizedScore': 0.38611209869384766\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.38611209869384766\n\n'documentId': 'bxnsMt8zhSJsMp4i2'\n'chunk_id': '687acada8248193de8e387cd'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 11\n'total_parts': 21\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Making Interactions Accessible to All Users\n'parentName': International JavaScript Conference Munich\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-10-24T08:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Are your websites accessible to all users?

Now, yeah, so yeah, that's a good question. I almost missed this point. Uh, yeah. Now sometimes, for example, here, uh, we have some complex inputs and we give some hints that what you can fill in this, maybe it's a date. So we say the format, it's a password. We let them know of the rules that this is the way in which you can have a valid password. Now, what happens for a screen reader user? So actually, let me take this to safari because, uh, one another note in this is every, how do I remove this? Okay, so every uh, system which we use, laptop or uh, desktop, every, uh, os comes with one screen reader, at least like for Mac, it comes with voiceover, and every operating system has a preferable, uh, screen reader. And also every screen reader has a browser, which, which they work best. So for example, in Mac Safari and Mac voiceover, I, they pair the best. So, uh, it's best to use Safari when we are using voiceover. So that will give us the best experience. So I will just start my voiceover here. Uh, and I'm just going through all of the elements. When I come to password, it says that password, password required, and it's a secure edit test. And okay, I think I did, I wait. Okay, so this is what I had to show. But like, normally if we don't do anything, we have a input, and if we have a a password with it, it's not going to read out the extra hint. So to make it accessible and to make this hint also announced to our users, what we can do is we can have something called Aria described by, so I have a span in which I have all the extra details for my password, and I go ahead and I say that, uh, aria described by, and I give the ID of that span. And in that case, I think you already saw the example, but I will go ahead and start the voiceover again. So yeah, so it's, it talks about password, that it's a required field, it's a secure edit test, and then it reads the hint password must be minimum eight characters. So it lets the user know. So if we do not provide this area described by the user will not know that, what are the extra information available with our, uh, input box. So this is again, one of the very important things in which we can, uh, make our, uh, controls accessible. Then, uh, with validation error messages again.

Uh, so here's a representation of, uh, how we handle with event in our, in our platform. Uh, so mainly we have two, uh, way to do this. We have the graph clear, API, um, that will help us to catch up everything related to behavioral tracking, things happening on the ui. And we do have, uh, all the events that are used by our, uh, internal, uh, event dis dispatcher. Um, everything that happened into our bonding context could be, uh, listened to and then, uh, converted into event, event tracking. All of this go is under led by our backend, followed by Symphony PHP, and go to our data warehouse. And when I'm in data warehouse, I'm taking a shortcut because in fact, we, everything goes through snowplow. So what is snowplow? Snowplow is an open source event tracking platform. Um, it's designed to collect process and analyze, uh, data. So, um, why are we using it? Mostly because it's, uh, open source, uh, is a, is a way to version event. Uh, it's cost efficiency and we can do enrichment. So for example, by enrichment, I mean we can add on top data on top of the actual data. Uh, meaning like you have a user agent, we will be able to extract information like, okay, is it a a desktop or mobile? Which version of the browser? Uh, this kind of data. Um, and yeah, so when we meant that we are sending this data to snowplow, in fact we're doing HP we are sending JSONs JSON to a, what we call a collector. And this collector is basically getting stream of json starting it into his memory, and at some point writing them to S3 on this. Uh, in S3, we do have a, another process that is running that we took the s and send it to Amazon Kinesis, uh, which is a, a, um, a service design to ingest and pro process, uh, stream of, uh, data in real time. Uh, that's where the validation and enrichment of the data happen. And then it will go again into a S3 bucket to be stored and, uh, into a Redshift, which is our database, uh, for the data warehouse and available immediately for the, um, uh, analysis purpose is, it will be available in, uh, in Luer, for example. Um, this is an example of, uh, how in fact is actually, uh, working.

They don't follow rules, you know, they don't have a process or governance like we do. You know, they don't have a ceo, they have to kind of appease, they don't have, um, you know, a boss in the same sense we do to to kind of appease as well. And because of that, they're able to think so much more creatively about what they do and they're able to leverage things that we wouldn't have even considered or think about particularly. They look, look at things like, um, imagining the worst, observing the obvious. They explore every potential access point. They're really into data, they're really into understanding our weakest link, how to exploit things like back doors. They literally go through our garbage to kind of figure out where are the weak points in our system. And as I say, the most interesting thing about the way we all work differently is a hacker will work differently to an engineer just because it's the way they address the challenge. So when I think about my days when I was a developer, I thought very sy systematically about how I went about doing things. So I would have a plan in place, I might have a hypothesis of how I want to achieve something. Um, and then I would put that into place. I would test it, uh, if look for the successes or fails, iterate on that, and then make conclusions. The hacker, however, they don't do spikes like I used to do, they fool around and find out there's no plan but a mission. And that mission is completely different to our mission, which is to build something that stands the test of time that hopefully makes us a bit of money that will hopefully delights our customers. Their mission is to break things specifically to break into your things. They don't need to consider anything else other than that. And they can discard results willy-nilly and just move on to the next weakest link. So engineers aim to be thorough. Hackers aim to be effective at any cost. And these may seem like minor nuances, however, when you put them all together, they have quite significant implications. And all this sounds a little bit like, um, armchair psychology from the security team, but you have to think, does this mean that this should be security's problem? Well we, first of all, you do need to know whose problem it is, but no, it shouldn't at least not exclusively be the problem of the security team. Um, this thinking creates an over the\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 38.41401672363281\n'normalizedScore': 0.3841401672363281\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.3841401672363281\n\n'documentId': 'uQLGQfccCGQepkM87'\n'chunk_id': '687b42f82b0a1813a73e44ef'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 6\n'total_parts': 23\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Welcome and Opening // Keynote: (Ab)User Experience: How the Dark Side of Product and Security Can Be Used for (Ab)User Stories, (Mis)Use Cases and Threat Modelling\n'parentName': IPC Berlin 2023\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-05-23T07:00:00.000Z'\n'abstract': We start with a welcome and conference introduction, followed by Jeff Watkins and Lianne Potters keynote: Security can often feel like an unapproachable and mysterious part of an organisation – the department of work prevention, the department of 'nope.'

Because that's what we all know is matters really for building modern and successful digital products. Alright, um, let's have a look on some, let's say, selected highlights of the following three main conference days. Um, for example, today, um, there's a full, let's say a track over the entire day about the impact generative AI has on traditional disciplines such as coding, such as designing, such as marketing, such as data analytics. And of course it is also combined with the question, okay, is this something which supports us? Is this something which disrupts the way we used to think about digital products? Is this something which is changing our business fundamentally, question marks. So I'd really like to invite all of you to join this track today, which is a webinar track. And also today, uh, after lunchtime, there is also a panel discussion about opportunities and about disrupting elements of generative ai. On the other hand, let's say on the PHP side, and you are free to choose what keynote you would like to, to choose, um, uh, you can also join the PHP keynote talking about the state of the art of the PHP community. On the one hand, we'd like to discuss with you, okay, what do you think about the current state of the art, of the current state of the PHP world? What do you miss? What could one improve? And the good thing is about is, um, the, some folks from the PHP foundation will be there, and you probably heard about the PHP foundation already. Uh, we'd really like to underline that this foundation is something which has probably been missing at the PHP community for, for many, many me many years because they're kind of bundling efforts in making well the PHP better, not only technology-wise, but also communication-wise. They, they really are interested in hearing from you, what do you think about the PHP world and what, what do you think, okay, could one improve and how things could be developed on the other end. Of course, they're also going to inform you, um, what they intend and what they are planning. So don't miss this PHP thing. If you are into PHP technologies tonight, right after the APO reception in the evening, I'd like to invite of all of you, uh, to another keynote, which is about innovation, the human\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 38.3869743347168\n'normalizedScore': 0.38386974334716795\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.38386974334716795\n\n'documentId': 'bxnsMt8zhSJsMp4i2'\n'chunk_id': '687acada8248193de8e387d3'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 14\n'total_parts': 21\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Making Interactions Accessible to All Users\n'parentName': International JavaScript Conference Munich\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-10-24T08:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Are your websites accessible to all users?

I'm here to share how we can change that. In this talk, we will explore best practices for building user interactions for websites that are accessible and user-friendly for our users. Using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes, we will cover strategies for interaction from a simple button to navigation, to different form elements and custom components.

Now, the problem is that, uh, what if someone is colorblind? So in that case, they might not be able to de detect only from color change if there is error or not. And even if there is error in which, which field the error is right? Apart from colorblindness, there is also cultural nuances. Like some cultures perceive some colors in a different way than others. Like there could be a way in which the red could be seen as positive and not as a error, some sort of thing. So there are different things. So we should not only rely on colors, but also provide a message maybe with the icon that there's a error and or something. So like, let's just not rely only on colors. There should be some other, uh, icon or, uh, message representation. So the user really understands that. What is that issue? So let's scenario, okay, so what makes our forms inaccessible is when we don't have our labels, or maybe if even if we have, they are not properly linked. Yeah, uh, only relying on colors for errors, and if we are not announcing the validation information or any information attached to our inputs. The other scenario is dynamic information, and this is what I covered already with forms, so I always keep this section separate, is we saw an example of dynamic information with our forms, with the messages, the server messages coming in a dynamic, but it does not need to be associated only with forms. There could be other fine form of dynamic information, like we always have these bubbles coming in, maybe some site and or we have some messages for maintenance or some information. So these could be some other forms of dynamic information. And what makes it inaccessible is if we do not announce it to our assistive tech users. So that will make it inaccessible interaction. Now the last scenario is models. Again, I'll just, let's go back to Chrome. Yeah. So models, again, models are, uh, complicated, uh, component, right? They are not, and until few months before, we did not have any component as well, a proper H T M L components for let's say dialogues or popovers. Now, with models, there are like different terminal laws. There are dialogues, popovers models and so on, which differ from each other slightly in the way. They are, uh, they open in the way we can close them or we can interact with them. I'm not going to go into detail, uh, of that. Uh, I would\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 37.9908447265625\n'normalizedScore': 0.379908447265625\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.379908447265625\n\n'documentId': 'bxnsMt8zhSJsMp4i2'\n'chunk_id': '687acad88248193de8e387c5'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 3\n'total_parts': 21\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Making Interactions Accessible to All Users\n'parentName': International JavaScript Conference Munich\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-10-24T08:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Are your websites accessible to all users?

Is it fine for the people in the back? You can read it, right? Okay, awesome. So, and this, this is also fine, I guess. Okay, awesome. So, uh, let's just see, uh, so this is a simple website where I have two buttons and yeah, I click, something is happening, not real login or signup is happening, but there are some actions. Now, the one thing I want to do is, let's say I'm just using keyboard. I'm, I'm a keyboard user and I'm trying to navigate here with keyboards, right? So, uh, I will start using tab to go. Let's say I want to log in. So I press tab, I press tab again and again. So like the links, uh, it's done and it's, it's gone up. But, uh, do you know where I am currently? I'm pressing the tab, right? But, okay, so with mouse, I know where the button is, I can go and click, but I'm tabbing and I don't know which button I'm on. So that is something which is a very common scenario, and I think like more than 80% of websites will fail in this, uh, this, uh, kind of feedback. And what is the culprit? So that's a very, a single line of code, which we kind of like remove when we say that, okay, our website is looking a bit ugly, so let's remove those. So let's see, I'm just trying to, uh, inspect it and I will have, let's say, uh, focus and what's happening. So there is a c s s outline. None. I mean, this is very common. I have seen it so many times, so many times in many places where I've worked as well. We just make this and the accessibility is gone. So let me remove this. And so there is a default browser outline, which is coming now, which should be there. We should never be using, uh, the outlines from any of our interactive elements because then it doesn't provide the visual feedback and it's not very accessible to the users who are interacting with our page. Now, uh, the designers might say that, okay, but this doesn't go well with our design system or the color system or whatever, right? We have a color scheme normally, so we, we can have a solution for that. So first thing is we should never remove it, outline none. And if we're doing it, there are different ways in which we can still make it accessible. Uh, is there, we can make use of styling. So there is a styling with\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 37.9908447265625\n'normalizedScore': 0.379908447265625\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.379908447265625\n\n'documentId': 'bxnsMt8zhSJsMp4i2'\n'chunk_id': '687acad88248193de8e387cb'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 9\n'total_parts': 21\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Making Interactions Accessible to All Users\n'parentName': International JavaScript Conference Munich\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-10-24T08:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Are your websites accessible to all users?

For example, in link, I right click, I get some extra functionality. There are different ways in which I can interact. I can say control click, and it takes me to another tab, it opens in another tab, and so on. Uh, plus also, if, let's say the script fails on the website, the link can still be clickable, but the button won't be because the script has failed on the page, on the button, if we say right click, it's not going to do anything. So there are different, uh, meanings to all these, uh, elements. So, uh, if we use proper elements, the interaction will be much better for all, all our users. Now, uh, a very famous debate, where should we use links? Where should we use buttons, right? So I'm not going to dive into that, uh, nuances. But, uh, one of the, uh, ways in which, uh, is we can figure out is if it does something, it's a button, like there's an action. If it takes us somewhere like we get navigated to other part of the page or to a different page or different U r L altogether, then it's a good candidate for making it a link. So yeah, button versus link. So let's go to, uh, next scenario. These are the recap of what we talked. What makes our buttons and links inaccessible is when we remove our outline using outline, none, let's not do that. Like I'm stressing it a lot because I see it a lot, lot. And okay, let's not use sym non semantic ss, T M L. Let's use semantic s t ml whenever possible. Uh, if we do not provide text for icon only buttons or links, again, it'll make it inaccessible, not using proper semantic s t ml, like using, uh, button for creating links will make it bit inaccessible. Now the next scenario is forms. Again, forms are very, very important, right? Uh, like we get information from user, all the feedback and everything from a form itself. There are different ways in which forms can be inaccessible. So let's go ahead and see this report again. So missing form labels is one of the most prominent errors on our web today. Uh, it again has not decreased much. Still around 46% is inaccessible like that. So why is it? Again, this is again, all of the examples are from my real life. I've seen this in the code base I was working in, or maybe I was auditing or testing for something, and I've seen these happen. So, uh, sometimes\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'index'\n'score': 37.9277458190918\n'normalizedScore': 0.37927745819091796\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.37927745819091796\n\n'documentId': 'bxnsMt8zhSJsMp4i2'\n'chunk_id': '687acade8248193de8e387f1'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 21\n'total_parts': 21\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Making Interactions Accessible to All Users\n'parentName': International JavaScript Conference Munich\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2023-10-24T08:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Are your websites accessible to all users?

So let's use button, like if you have to go ahead and use roll equal to button or something, just use button tap for that. I Would say. Yeah, yeah, sure. Okay. Yeah, No, no, no. Good question. Yeah. Uh, so yeah, color contrast for colorblind people. Okay, so I think these are two different things. Uh, I do not have much, uh, um, insights on that. Uh, but uh, yeah, that's why I said that we should not rely only on colors, because color contrast is one aspect where, uh, if this not good, nobody can be able to read it. Like even a colorblind person, or even if, if you don't have any colorblindness, we might not be able to read it. Uh, the colorblindness aspect is where we are just using color for passing on some information to user, but that user might be perceiving it as a different color. Uh, an example could be acro topia in that, uh, the user only sees in shades of gray, like black, white, and gray in between, right? So any color we use, it's only gray scale for them, right? So they still will not be able to use. So like there are different, uh, ways in which when we are using graphs and we just use colors instead of that, we can use patterns and so on. But it's a whole different huge topic, and I do not have in-depth knowledge about it. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

No, I have time. Huh? 40 minute. I think we said that session. They do force you off. Nice. I'm nice of them. Okay. Oh, I'm on enterprise for sure. I'm logged in. They might not be, but my client is on enterprise. You're right. So for the people in the room, I'm just gonna keep going. We have five minutes left if that's okay. I wonder if I could get the screen share back. Mm. They don't have a dongle. These things were kind of important. Do you guys wanna come up and we'll just look at my laptop together?

Most o11y stacks today are drowning in telemetry, buried in cost overruns, and spread so thin across tools that they’ve become more noise than signal. The classic SaaS-based model is cracking. This talk lays out 4 foundational principles for building a sustainable observability posture that scale with infra and budget: - Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC): SaaS o11y is financially unsustainable at scale. - Consolidate or Bust: DevEx suffers when visibility is fragmented- consolidation isn’t a luxury - it’s a requirement. - Standardize Everything: Open protocols, pluggable pipelines, and vendor-neutral APIs are the only way forward, or your o11y is a ticking liability. - Self-Reliance: You can’t rely on app-level instrumentation forever - eBPF enables scalable o11y without complexity This session pulls from real-world deployments and lessons learned helping engineering teams scale visibility without compromise.\n'parentId': '95365f839e72d6fa014ee003'\n'parentDescription': The Conference for CI/CD, the Kubernetes Ecosystem, Agile & Lean Business\n'indexBrandName': 'DevOpsCon'\n'indexSeriesName': 'NewYork'\n'author': 'Noam Levy'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': of our application or how their applications are behaving or having a lot of production issues. They have only observability in production because it's too expensive. They don't do observability development, they do not shift it left to earlier stages, and thus they are just experiencing more, uh, urgent issues. If you observe every stage, You will observe at earlier stage. If you observe at earlier stage, you'll all get less PagerDuty alerts while sleeping. Uh, and yeah, that's about it. I was speaking about ground cover at the beginning, but uh, yeah, if you want to try out one of this concept, you can try the ground cover. Uh, but uh, questions I think we can use the room until they will kick me out, but, uh, feel free to ask questions. Awesome.

In a perfect world, applications never fail, but the reality is that outages are inevitable. It remains imperative for IT departments to reduce both the frequency and duration of these disruptions. Despite the clear advantages, many organizations are reluctant to embrace automation due to entrenched manual processes and a lack of resources. In this session, we’ll explore how automation—when combined with real-time observability — can proactively prevent outages and accelerate recovery when incidents do occur. We’ll cover best practices and common challenges in building automation strategies that are both scalable and sustainable. Attendees will leave with actionable insights into how observability-driven automation can improve operational resilience and drive continuous improvement across the software delivery lifecycle.\n'parentId': '063e56863209e0bb8ad7534b'\n'parentDescription': The Conference for CI/CD, Kubernetes Ecosystem, Agile & Lean Business\n'indexBrandName': 'DevOpsCon'\n'indexSeriesName': 'SanDiego'\n'author': 'Kevin Wang'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': of Dynatrace, would love to have you guys swing by.

'Over promised, over sold and over here', if you're in a company of more than 50 people and growing you're almost guaranteed to have creating a platform to help you scale safely and cost-effectively. But how do you doge the disillusionment and develop what delivers? In this entertaining and thoughtful keynote, Russ Miles (Developer, Listener, Author and Builder of platforms) will unpack the myths around platform engineering. Touring a collection of real-world examples where platforms swim or sink through the lense of philosophy, Russ will explore the many choices you can make that will make the difference between a successful platform that your teams will love and a franken-platform that no one wants to touch. Together we'll explore which myths hold and which fold under scrutiny so that you have the best possible chance of building a loved internal developer platform. Why?

But what about the client side? The W3C's Reporting API, Content-Security-Policy, Network Error Logging (NEL), and Reporting-Endpoints HTTP headers can let you know about all kinds of client-side issues that you'd otherwise never see.

Um, the one I find quite interesting is the permissions policy. That's another HT TB header. And that is something that allows you to specify exactly which kind of browser features that your site makes use of. So say for example, your website doesn't use audio input, so you don't have the ability to, you know, uh, stream video or something from, from your, from your browser. You can say there's no microphone access in this site, but then you have a script that tries to use it, that's gonna be a permissions policy violation, and you can have it report that. And it also uses the report to mechanism and will hit that reporting endpoint for you. Now, there's a problem with getting a third party to receive these things is that if you, if you set up a third party location as the reporting target, it is a privacy issue because you are leaking information to that third party without any knowledge of the client. Um, and that's generally a bad situation to be in from say A-G-D-P-R perspective. Um, because the reports are sent directly by the client, it means that their user agent, their ip, the fact that they're there at all, and the time and the frequency and all the pages within that site that they have visited, uh, across all of your users that have been doing this, assuming they're the ones that actually are all hitting the same errors, you are leaking quite a lot of information to this third party that has no particular reason to know that information other for your technical purposes. And because of that leakage, this is reported by this particular scanner, which I'm a big fan of, um, it will report these third party, um, uh, reporting endpoints as being privacy leaks. And the solution to that really is to proxy that reporting service because although you might want to benefit from all the aggregation and searching and, and reporting features of that third party service, you might not want to have the privacy leak that goes with it. So if you proxy it through your own app, you're gonna lose out on the IP address of the client. And the only thing that that's really gonna affect is things like geographical problems. So say for example, France decides to block PornHub like they did this week, apparently it caused a 10000% spike in VPN registrations. This was literally in the last day. Uh, um, so, uh, they don't want, you don't want this kind of privacy leakage to go on. And so, uh, you can receive the reports yourself and then\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'vector'\n'score': 0.8854694366455078\n'normalizedScore': 0.876795796775518\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.8854694366455078\n\n'documentId': '397799dd2e15da87e8f11535'\n'chunk_id': '68a456bc9f706f00135a47c1'\n'access': 'granted'\n'part_number': 6\n'total_parts': 17\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Solve 100% of your errors: How to root cause issues faster with Session Replay & User Feedback\n'parentName': iJS San Diego 2025\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2025-05-21T09:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': You know that annoying bug?

So if you're just trying out session replay for the first time and you don't know if you have PII data or sensitive data, you should be safe. You will be safe because it will be masked. And then you can be like, my philosophy is it's better to be like, oh, I'd rather see this. Let me go fix it. Instead of having someone from your legal department come over and be like, I don't want to see that, you have to fix it now. And that all happens on the, on the device. Uh, so let's debug this thing. So in this replay, there's tons and tons of errors and not all of them are coming from the front end. Um, so let's play through and see what we see. So if we hit play, and I'm gonna do that. So this is the session replay, and we're literally able to watch what the user was doing. And here they've clicked submit. And it might have been going slow even on this page when this user was, um, testing things out. So there it goes. See, slowness can pop up at any time. And here they go. It's so slow that they're clicking many, many, many times. And we're gonna come up to an error here. I can see on the timeline. Uh, so yeah, there's the, it's, we've detected all these things. We've detected the rage clicks, we've detected backhand errors. This is an example of how replay is showing you the user experience and connecting all of your data from the front end to the backend. Uh, so one of the errors that I really like to, to, um, demo with is something called an n plus one query. This is something on the backend, and this is the reason why this replay is so slow. So as a backend engineer, you might get a notification about an error like this. Uh, we're doing a select star from our products table product bundles, and we want to know about a specific product id. Uh, what makes this an n plus one error is if we're asking about different product IDs in a loop, what would be better is if we asked for a list of product IDs all at once and then looped over it just in our application. So we only have to talk to the database once. And so as a backend engineer, you're like, okay, I see what the query is. Uh, but you have no idea what the user impact is.

Uh, for earth. There will be, uh, quite a bit more configuration parameters that can be associated. In fact, it's, uh, it's UI exposes only. Also on also limited subset. There may be a lot more exposed behind the scene, uh, through more detailed configurations. Uh, but the point I'm trying to make is that these policies registered independently as such in the, uh, catalog. And you can see through the dependencies, like this one, it is used by two APIs. So I can clearly see the dependency, dependency tracking. I can go to jump to that API, which is registered here. It is, that's the one that's registered. And if I look at the endpoint, I will see that its policy uses basic quote, and it is a reference, you see, it says used as a shared policy. So we picked it up, that policy actually from the catalog tree itself, because it is, it is registered here as an independent object, and we reference it, uh, in case of our product. We, we can still, you know, assign private policy, meaning maintain one-to-one relationship and configuration if that's what customers want. But if you want to achieve scalability, you'd better be using references. Very similar thing, um, with the access controls. Uh, and I'll just briefly show the, the idea. So let's say in a folder, I can create the access rule, which can be designed graphically, and I can say, uh, let's say I can say any of these conditions, and I will say, let's say, uh, this particular username, and actually I'll say all of them, any of these, let's say end all, uh, rearrange them by drag and drop. So if the idea, I'm saying if a user a, a, a, and it's, uh, let's say on a particular daytime schedule, and on a particular, let's say also restriction on IP addresses and, uh, with particular transaction count, meaning, uh, particular rate limit, right? I'll specify. So I'm graphically designing my complex combination of conditions, and I can use a lot of them. And once the access rule is created, registered in the repository or in API catalog, so, uh, this is the new rule that I am creating. Once it is registered, I'm not gonna save it. I'm not gonna finish that process. Just show you some example. Well, maybe, um, well, basically what you do, you, you take, uh, any API I'll, I'll just pick some version.

And in today's world, the answer is really false. If you have the right architecture in place, you can search data, whether it's in an object store, whether it's in your observability tool, or even all the way out at the end point before, uh, before it's batched and, and found its way over. Another concept is, um, and I think it's really been propagated by observability vendors, is, uh, data, uh, tiering is often thought about as the age of the data. You know, most tools have a retention period of, uh, sometimes seven days, sometimes 30 days. Uh, and, and then it often gets, uh, aged out to some sort of an archive format. Um, now the question is, should that become the basis of what lives in my observability tool and what doesn't or should it become increasingly, uh, what is the kind of data that is best queried in a particular observability tool? And that really changes the dynamics too. If you really start to think about tiering around what are the use cases that you have and where, what the value of that data is, you can really start to flip that crank, uh, thinking. And again, just think about what data is critical, not because of just recency, but because you run dashboards on it. It's critical for alerting. It's the kind of thing that people are going to query on all the time, having a sense of what is important data, which means that people are accessing it, but it's not being actively used for monitoring systems and things like that. And the question is, if there are certain datas I'll get great example here is debug logs. Um, debug logs are things that when you need 'em, you need 'em, but they don't have to go into a 20 some dollars per gigabyte, um, uh, monitoring system in order to gain access to them. You can have a tool that simply, if you had the tool that explores, uh, and can perform a search against those object storage, uh, you're able to\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'vector'\n'score': 0.8814975023269653\n'normalizedScore': 0.8716218076624549\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.8814975023269653\n\n'documentId': '95d95fdd7f9d433a11bbf12b'\n'chunk_id': '6876d7dd225e92fc1ac7b4c6'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 18\n'total_parts': 18\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Agentic Workflows – Stories from the Engine Room\n'parentName': webinale 2025\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2025-06-03T10:15:00.000Z'\n'abstract': Everyone talks about Agentic Workflows, but what really happens behind the scenes?

That's how it works. Uh, limited customization, again. Second, uh, especially on the tech side, uh, you might not have a lot of ways to customize these models, uh, as compared to private models. Private models, uh, depending on the, the power you have with the technology knowledge, you can go down deeper and control a lot and change a lot, customize a lot, basically. But in the, uh, for public models, it's gonna be hard to do that because they don't offer a lot of ways of doing that. Correct. Uh, and then obviously you are always dependent on third party services, which basically means you're reliant on the providers, and as long as they work, you work, something goes down there, yours goes down here as well. Normal. This, this can happen with cloud services as well. Like a AWS goes down your server are on too. So that's something people are very well aware of, but it, it's a risk to a certain level, uh, when you use this. So one of the case studies I'll highlight, uh, something that we have done. We started with public, we went to private, that's why I'm trying to show this. Uh, we run this in a convener, uh, convenience store in Arizona. Um, what does it do? It started as a, as the application. Who was going to track? Uh, the application was tracking the products on the app. Simple, nothing fancy, right? What does that mean is as a store manager, when your store gets busy, you don't have a lot of people you should know which thing is finishing where, correct? So it will track these things and it'll ping you on the app to say on aisle five, this product is running low, you should go check it out, correct? And to do that, uh, not a lot of heavy lifting because, uh, these stores already have cameras installed. You don't have to do anything fancy. You tap into the camera, get the feed, and you can build this stuff around. That's what we did. Uh, we started it with public models. Again, because this videos technically to a certain extent are publicly available in a way where when you walk into a store, it says you're being recorded, correct? They're already telling you it's recorded, so there's nothing you can do. Yes, you can't use people's faces. So we gotta blur these things out. But you can use the video to a certain extent. Uh, started\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'vector'\n'score': 0.8905695676803589\n'normalizedScore': 0.8687646492715563\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.8905695676803589\n\n'documentId': '4doenYnEh5ucx97yT'\n'chunk_id': '687a2bf5495b49563aa87b9a'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 16\n'total_parts': 25\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Decoding Enterprise AI for Devs: Choosing Between Private LLMs and Public Generative AI Services\n'parentName': ML Con New York 2024\n'language': 'EN'\n'date': '2024-10-08T15:30:00.000Z'\n'abstract': \n'parentId': 'D26qSfsi7D43xAqFR'\n'parentDescription': The Event For Machine Learning Technologies & Innovations\n'indexBrandName': 'MLCon'\n'indexSeriesName': 'NewYork'\n'author': 'Shomron Jacob'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': recorded, correct? They're already telling you it's recorded, so there's nothing you can do. Yes, you can't use people's faces. So we gotta blur these things out. But you can use the video to a certain extent. Uh, started with the public model, but then we realized over time that this application can grow in multiple ways and it can become cheaper. So what we did is we went to a version two where we built s SLMs to power this application, and we scaled the application as well. So now, apart from looking at the items on the shelf, it also tells you when people spill stuff on the floor, or if there's some sort of a person walking around with a gun, it'll ping that as well, that you know, someone's there with a gun in your store. That as well is there. And we then took this application and we installed it inside the camera. It's literally running in these things, watching around. So it's gone to that small chip level, uh, stuff that we have done again, and then this is possible, uh, to run at a certain extent. Then version three, we figured out this application was growing was a club of SLM. So we took it out of the camera, put it on an tu server running inside the store. So now it runs on a server that is sitting literally in one of the back doors, and that talks to all the cameras live, and then that cameras is powering your, uh, feed. And then the language models are running at the back. Simple. Uh, the reason I show this example is because this is how we even started with public. We turned around and did private, and we figured out it's much simpler to control things can be, we can add more value for clients, uh, they can scale better and cheaper, and there's a lot of customizations that we could do for them. So, and they could do for themselves. It really depends on who's trying to do what. But they could add a lot of things too. So like the spilling algorithm was added on the fly, the threat detection was added on the fly. That's the third one, correct? So similar to that, this thing is growing day by day, and you can just bring in different models to handle this and run it together. So this is one of my favorite examples to show, uh, how we also went from public and realized private was a better solution here. Uh, the things to watch out for in this, uh, example on the right, if you see is obviously the video quality\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'vector'\n'score': 0.8901958465576172\n'normalizedScore': 0.8683909281488146\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.8901958465576172\n\n'documentId': 'dce7ae663edaa8e06a2be0e9'\n'chunk_id': '68ac7f0f494be90012217c6e'\n'access': 'restricted'\n'part_number': 3\n'total_parts': 30\n'contentType': 'RHEINGOLD'\n'title': Eröffnungskeynote zu Web-Security 2025\n'parentName': BASTA!

If you give your LLM unrestricted permissions, there's no way to monitor. I mean, it's just after the fact. Um, but to effectively monitor, treat your LLM as just another user with permissions now, then you can set boundaries on the tasks, um, that it, it should be able to handle, right? And that's something tangible, um, that you can monitor. So that's the first step, right? So think of this playbook as a litmus test. Um, 'cause this is so new. Like if somebody tries to sell you a quantifiable framework, I mean, it's just so new. So think of it as a series of questions to work through, right? As a playbook, um, to have something, uh, for L and mops and, and security. Um, so next is logging, right? Some people will tell you, yeah, log all that data, put it into a sim security information event management system of sorts, and then read all those behaviors and try to figure out what's going on, right? Having a learning mechanism when there's anomalies, Hey, the dis user all of a sudden try to access this sensitive proprietary technology, or there's really powerful AI capability, right? It is not typical of them to do this, right? So why that request, why that access? You log that and you prompt that, right? You, you audit that. Um, and that's the second step of, of the logging part. Um, then, um, of course, uh, there's policies, right? So think of the Google Safe framework, what Databricks is doing right there. There's policies, there's configurations in place for what needs to happen, uh, as far as like the data, um, and, and accounting for bias, right? This reminds me of a supply chain threat, right? If if the data that you're using contains bias, then that's gonna roll up right to the output of an LLM. So think about the supply chain, um, and then have a way to evaluate the outcomes, right? Um, in, in that output, right? And that has to be part of your policy. Google Save Databricks, um, and some government agencies have great, uh, places to start with what, what that policy should be. Um, and then of course, um, in zero trust, right? Um, never trust, always verify, you know, uh, verif, we put enough guardrails so that somebody doesn't like put a prompt injection, and you have to really have to keep up with these every week.

Uh, you could have, uh, um, a silent base video, get some text to create, uh, context to create what to say there, and then dub it in different languages. So, uh, again, if you, you know, if you have worked in the entertainment industry, what used to happen in the past is they were content creators, let's say large studios. They used to send raw files to, uh, the, the people who could then stream it. And that file had to be transcribed, it had to be changed in size, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Uh, subtitles, so on and so forth, took a lot of time. All of that can potentially now, will potentially, now change, will take time. Yes, not all of this technology is a hundred percent, um, mature, but when adoption happens, you will see, uh, maturity because there will be feedback from people that this works, this doesn't work. And that feedback loop will always make the products better. And there'll be new products in this, uh, in this, um, uh, forum itself yesterday and today, I have met around four, uh, people who have their own startups, right? Everyone doing something around lms, interesting use cases that kind of, uh, that kind of interest that has peaked, uh, will lead to some really good outcomes, right? So, um, how long? Oh, 30 minutes. That's it. Those are the things that I had, uh, I would want to see if anyone has questions or even your, your, uh, point of view. Yes, ma'am. Um, I just wanted to ask, um, what you've shown before in terms of, um, first line that you had experience. So I think what we're seeing, I don't know on the internet, you can consent or not, um, to kind of have personalized content be tracked, really. Uh, but in reality, that's gonna happen to me at a mall. Can I remove my consent? Because it's initially kind of manipulating the user into buying more, into further consumption.

Classic streaming has delay about 40 seconds, and video conferencing is, uh, around subsecond, uh, less than 500 milliseconds. So how can we overcome these technical limitations? Very simple. We simply do both. So we have a video conference here, which is the interactive mode. And for example, Dimitri is Athena Carson, this information is for you. Uh, if you want to interact with us, switch to the interactive mode. Uh, if you just wanna watch and, uh, uh, just look what we are doing here. You can, uh, switch to standard mode, uh, and, uh, yeah, follow the, the sessions throughout the day using a classical live streaming experience. Great. So in order to get used to it a little bit, I just want to have a warmup. It's, it's early in the morning. It's Monday. Okay. So I guess you're a little bit tired, maybe from traveling or whatever, or from watching football. Are any football fans here in a room? It's so great. That's the best audience I ever had. I, I actually, I don't know nothing about football, so. Great. Okay. Very cool. Doesn't matter. Uh, what, what I want to do is that you, uh, here on site, just clap your hands for the online audience. So yeah, welcome. Great. And now, and now we do the other things I would like to ask the online participants to applaud for the onsite, uh, people Here, you have an icon. Clap your hands. Icons at the lower, uh, right bottom of the application. Just try. You can't do, uh, any harm. Just try. Please do it. Yeah. Cool. More if you want. Just do it more. Hit it a little bit harder. Okay, Robin. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much. So you see how it works. You can throw your emotions, you can throw your text, anything you like, just throw it on stage, participate with us, don't hesitate. Uh, and just do it so that we can have a real hybrid experience here. Okay. Very cool. That's, uh, it for the start. Before we start with the actual talks, I would like to tell you a little story. And this story is about innovation. I don't know whether you know this thing here. Do you know what it is? Coffee. Coffee? Yeah. Special kind of coffee. Instant coffee. Okay. And as the inventors call it blitz coffee, it's, it's interesting.

The ever-increasing number of available services and a growing ecosystem can further increase the confusion or perceived risk of going serverless. This talk will build on 7 years of experience building and maintaining serverless solutions to walk through the ground-up design of a brand-new serverless application. We’ll discuss common questions and concerns including data architecture, security, cost, and maintainability. The solution will be shown using a combination of system diagrams, as well as platform and code examples in Firebase and Google Cloud.\n'parentId': 'iWdBZ3cbPM5wcMtRc'\n'parentDescription': Mastering Cloud Native Architectures, Serverless Development and Functions\n'indexBrandName': 'ServerlessArchitectureCon'\n'indexSeriesName': ''\n'author': 'Michael Dowden'\n'chunkSource': 'text'\n'text': huge, just a few megabytes, but we still blew past our whatever gigabyte threshold quota in a couple hours because every single thing that did that particular step of the check-in process was downloading the entire database. So that's bad. And like some of these things you just find out the hard way. You run into it and you're like, oh, I shouldn't do that anymore. I mean, it wasn't ter it was like, I don't even know, a hundred bucks not a big deal. It's not the end of the world. But that's why I really like turning on, uh, notifications on different pricing points. Like I know that generally I'm gonna spend this every month. So if you go over that, let me know immediately please. 'cause I wanna, I want the heads up, Uh, on the breakthrough parts. Yep. You just passed like the, the user authorization? Yeah. You're just passing like user ID or something. So, so yeah, we're, the reason we're passing user ID is so that we have the option that the users have the option of storing their payment method or not. I mean, they, they have that choice, but I want to allow them to do that because, uh, one of the thing, the challenges that we have is like 50% of our users are daily, or at least weekly users of the system. But the other 50% use it like, I don't know, once or twice a year or maybe one time ever. And so I need to make it as user friendly as possible for the people that use it all the time. I don't want them to have to enter their payment information every single time they use the application. But for the other people, maybe they don't want to do that, but I have to tie the payment to the user ID in order to be able to do that as part of the platform. Cool. Well, thank you all very much. I need to go ahead and clear up for the next speaker, but I'll hang out if you need, wanna talk.\n'slidetext': ''\n'from': 'vector'\n'score': 0.8840720653533936\n'normalizedScore': 0.8522911195473306\n'beforeDatePenaltyScore': 0.8840720653533936\n\n\n Dieser Content von  ist in deiner Sprache nicht verfügbar.
