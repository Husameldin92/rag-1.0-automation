Here’s how it works and why it’s useful:\n\nPurpose of useMemo:  \n\nIt memorizes a computed value between renders.  \nThe value is recalculated only if one or more dependencies in the dependency array change.  \nThis avoids unnecessary recalculations on every render, which can improve performance especially for expensive computations.\n\n\nHow to use useMemo:  \n\nYou pass two arguments to useMemo:  \nA function that returns the value you want to memoize.  \nAn array of dependencies that determine when the memoized value should be recalculated.\n\n\nExample:  const sortedItems = useMemo(() => {\n  return items.sort((a, b) => a.value - b.value);\n}, [items]);\n\n\nIn this example, the sorting only happens again if the items array changes.\n\n\nBehavior details:  \n\nOn the first render, the function inside useMemo runs and the result is stored.  \nOn subsequent renders, React compares the current dependencies with the previous ones. If none have changed, React returns the cached value without running the function again.  \nIf dependencies have changed, the function runs again to compute a new value.\n\n\nWhen to use useMemo:  \n\nFor expensive calculations that you want to avoid repeating unnecessarily.  \nTo prevent recalculations when the inputs have not changed.  \nHowever, premature optimization should be avoided; only use useMemo when you have identified performance bottlenecks.\n\n\nRelation to other hooks:  \n\nuseMemo is similar to useEffect in that both take a dependency array, but useMemo returns a memoized value, whereas useEffect is for side effects.  \nuseCallback is a specialized form of useMemo for memoizing functions.\n\n\nExample from practical React usage:  \n\nInstead of storing derived data like sorted lists in state and updating it with effects, you calculate it during rendering and memoize it with useMemo. This leads to simpler, more predictable code.  \nFor instance, sorting a large list only when the list or sort criteria change, rather than on every render.  \nThis approach avoids unnecessary state updates and effects, reducing bugs and improving readability.\n\n\nImportant notes:  \n\nThe dependencies array is required for useMemo.  \nThe memoized value is a new object or value; React does not do deep comparisons, so you must ensure dependencies are correctly specified.  \nOverusing useMemo can complicate code and sometimes add overhead, so it should be used judiciously.\n\n\n\nIn summary, useMemo in React is a hook that helps optimize rendering performance by caching the result of expensive computations and recalculating them only when necessary, based on dependency changes. It encourages writing cleaner and more efficient React components by avoiding redundant recalculations during renders [1.]   [2.] .\nIf you want, I can also provide code examples or explain how useMemo fits into larger React performance strategies.\n\nSources\n\nHooked on Hooks in React This conference talk explains how React hooks work under the covers, covering useRef, useState, useEffect, useMemo, and useCallback to build mental models and custom hooks. ℹ️ This talk of International JavaScript New York was part of a past event.
