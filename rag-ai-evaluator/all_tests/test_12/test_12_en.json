Manfred SteyerJavaScript Magazine Issue 9How do I enable feature X in the newest Angular if it’s not in your docs?When a feature (like your 'feature X') is not yet documented in the official Angular docs or widely covered in existing materials, especially in the newest Angular versions, here are the best practices and approaches to enable or explore it based on the latest insights from the Angular ecosystem as of late 2025:\n\nCheck for Experimental or Developer Preview FeaturesAngular often introduces new capabilities as experimental or developer preview features before they become fully stable and documented. These features may require explicit opt-in via flags, special imports, or configuration in your project setup. For example, Signals, linkedSignal(), resource(), and httpResource in Angular 19 and 20 started as experimental features that you enable by importing from specific Angular core packages or using new APIs.  \n\nLook for announcements or talks from recent Angular conferences or workshops where such features are introduced.  \nUse Angular CLI or package updates to ensure you have the latest version that might include these features.  \nSometimes, enabling experimental features requires adding specific flags in tsconfig.json or Angular configuration files.\n\n\nExplore Angular’s Standalone APIs and Provider FactoriesNew Angular features often come as standalone APIs or provider factories that do not require NgModules. For example, standalone components and standalone APIs allow you to import and configure features directly in components or bootstrap code.  \n\nLook for provider functions named like provideXyz() or feature toggles like withAbc() in the Angular packages or community libraries.  \nThese patterns allow you to enable or configure features by adding them to your application’s providers array or bootstrap logic.\n\n\nUse Community and Conference Resources for Early Access KnowledgeSince official docs may lag behind, valuable information often comes from:  \n\nConference talks (e.g., International JavaScript Conference, Angular Camp, BASTA!) where Angular team members or experts present new features and usage patterns.  \nArticles and columns by Angular experts like Manfred Steyer, Michael Egger-Zikes, or Felix Schütz, who share practical tips and code examples for new Angular capabilities.  \nWorkshops and tutorials that dive deep into modern Angular features such as Signals, Control Flow syntax, standalone components, and new router capabilities.\n\n\nCheck Angular’s GitHub Repository and RFCsAngular’s GitHub repo and RFC (Request for Comments) documents sometimes provide early insights and usage examples for upcoming features.  \n\nLook for issues or pull requests tagged with experimental or feature names.  \nReview example code or test cases that demonstrate how to enable or use the feature.\n\n\nExperiment with Angular CLI Schematics and Migration ToolsFor features related to modernization or refactoring (e.g., migrating to standalone components or new router APIs), Angular provides schematics that can help enable or convert your codebase.  \n\nUse commands like ng generate component --standalone or migration schematics to adopt new features safely.  \nThese tools often handle the necessary configuration changes automatically.\n\n\nEngage with Angular DevTools and Debugging ToolsAngular DevTools can help you inspect your app’s runtime behavior and verify if experimental features are active or working as expected.  \n\nSome features require explicit enabling in DevTools or runtime flags.\n\n\nFallback: Use Feature Flags or Custom ProvidersIf the feature is very new or internal, you might need to enable it via custom providers or feature flags in your app’s dependency injection system, following patterns used in Angular’s own libraries (e.g., NgRx or Router).  \n\nThis involves creating provider factories or configuration objects that toggle the feature on or off.\n\n\n\nSummary:To enable a new or undocumented feature in the latest Angular: look for experimental APIs or developer previews, use standalone API provider patterns, consult recent expert talks and articles, explore Angular’s GitHub and RFCs, leverage CLI schematics for migration, and use Angular DevTools for inspection. This approach aligns with how Angular evolves features like Signals, httpResource, and standalone components, which initially appeared outside official docs but were accessible through community and conference content [1.]  [2.]  [3.]  [4.].\nIf you have a specific feature in mind, I can help you find the most relevant recent expert content or conference sessions that cover it in detail.\n\nSources\n\nRenovate your Angular App!
