Based on the provided documents, here are key points and best practices to avoid typical pitfalls:\n\nInefficient Layering and Caching  \n\nDocker builds images in layers, and each command in a Dockerfile creates a new layer. If commands that change frequently (like copying source code) are placed before commands that rarely change (like installing dependencies), Docker's cache is invalidated more often, leading to longer build times.  \nBest practice: Place commands that change less frequently (e.g., installing dependencies) before copying application source code to maximize cache reuse.  \nUse multi-stage builds to separate build-time dependencies from runtime images, reducing image size and attack surface.Q8umqYEAyRP5QsNB“The first thing you actually want to do is put all the dependencies ... prior to the files that change frequently ... so you save a lot of time on npm install.”Q8umqYEAyRP5QsNB“Multi-stage builds ... reduce the size of the docker image because we don't carry the entire SDK with us.”\n\n\nIncluding Build Tools in Production Images  \n\nLeaving build tools and SDKs in the final image increases size and potential security risks.  \nBest practice: Use multi-stage builds where the first stage contains build tools and the second stage contains only the runtime environment and built artifacts.AuLbLsuCJeJD“You don't want build tools in production image ... so split the Dockerfile into build and runtime stages.”\n\n\nUsing Unpinned or Latest Tags for Base Images  \n\nUsing unpinned tags like latest can lead to non-reproducible builds and unexpected changes when base images update.  \nBest practice: Pin base images to specific versions or digests to ensure reproducible builds.AuLbLsuCJeJD“Including a specific image digest ... ensures reproducible builds and avoids unexpected changes.”\n\n\nNot Managing Secrets Securely  \n\nHardcoding secrets or environment variables in Dockerfiles or images can expose sensitive data.  \nBest practice: Use build arguments or external secret management tools; avoid embedding secrets in images.Q8umqYEAyRP5QsNB“Use build arguments for secrets ... they are only available during build and not in the final image.”\n\n\nNot Using Non-Root Users  \n\nRunning containers as root increases security risks if the container is compromised.  \nBest practice: Create and switch to a non-root user in the Dockerfile for running the application.Q8umqYEAyRP5QsNB“Don't use root user ... attackers get full access if container runs as root.”\n\n\nIgnoring Image Size Optimization  \n\nLarge images increase deployment time and resource usage.  \nBest practice: Use minimal base images (e.g., Alpine), remove unnecessary files, and combine commands to reduce layers and image size.Q8umqYEAyRP5QsNB“Using Alpine base images ... results in smaller images.”\n\n\nNot Using Health Checks and Proper Entrypoints  \n\nOmitting health checks can lead to undetected container failures.  \nBest practice: Define HEALTHCHECK instructions and use ENTRYPOINT and CMD properly to control container startup and lifecycle.AuLbLsuCJeJD“Use ENTRYPOINT for commands that should not be overridden and CMD for default arguments.”\n\n\nNot Using .dockerignore Files  \n\nIncluding unnecessary files in the build context increases build time and image size.  \nBest practice: Use .dockerignore files to exclude files and directories not needed in the image.AuLbLsuCJeJD“The .dockerignore file excludes files from the build context, similar to .gitignore.”\n\n\nNot Leveraging Docker Compose or Orchestration Tools for Multi-Container Apps  \n\nManually managing multiple containers can be error-prone.  \nBest practice: Use Docker Compose files to define multi-container applications with clear service dependencies, volumes, and networks.f2fcda5ae“Docker Compose manages images and containers, describing configuration for all services.”\n\n\nNot Cleaning Up After Builds  \n\nLeaving temporary files or build artifacts in images increases size and complexity.  \nBest practice: Clean package caches and temporary files in the same RUN command to avoid bloated layers.Q8umqYEAyRP5QsNB“Combine package installation and cleanup in one RUN command to reduce image size.”\n\n\n\nSummary:Common Dockerfile mistakes include inefficient layering that leads to slow builds, including build tools in production images, using unpinned base images, insecure handling of secrets, running containers as root, large image sizes, missing health checks, not using .dockerignore, poor multi-container management, and leaving build artifacts in images. Following best practices such as multi-stage builds, pinning image versions, using non-root users, optimizing image size, and leveraging orchestration tools can greatly improve Docker image quality and deployment reliability.\nIf you want, I can also provide example Dockerfile snippets illustrating these best practices.",
