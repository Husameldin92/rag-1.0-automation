## üîç EVALUATION ANALYSIS

### Criterion Assessment:

1. **Discovery data must include only chunks with parentGenre 'TUTORIAL' when user specifies 'tutorials only'**
   - **Analysis**: The AI response is based on the keyword "React useEffect tutorials," which implies a focus on tutorial content. The discovery data includes chunks with the parentGenre 'TUTORIAL', such as "Einstieg in React" and "PWA mit React." However, it also includes chunks with other parentGenres like 'null' and 'RHEINGOLD' (e.g., "React¬†16: What‚Äôs new?" and "React beyond the Basics").
   - **Result**: ‚ùå The discovery data includes non-tutorial chunks, which violates the criterion.

2. **Discovery data must NOT include chunks with other parentGenre values (RHEINGOLD, null, etc.)**
   - **Analysis**: The discovery data contains chunks with parentGenres 'RHEINGOLD' and 'null', such as "React beyond the Basics" and "React¬†16: What‚Äôs new?" These should not be included when the user specifies 'tutorials only'.
   - **Result**: ‚ùå Non-tutorial chunks are present in the discovery data.

3. **AI response must be based only on tutorial content and mention it's from tutorials**
   - **Analysis**: The AI response provides an overview of the useEffect hook and states that the summary is drawn from "multiple React tutorials." This indicates that the response is based on tutorial content.
   - **Result**: ‚úÖ The response is based on tutorial content and mentions tutorials.

4. **No citations or references to non-tutorial content types should appear in the response**
   - **Analysis**: The AI response does not explicitly cite or reference non-tutorial content types. It maintains a focus on tutorial content throughout the explanation.
   - **Result**: ‚úÖ The response does not reference non-tutorial content types.

### üìä OVERALL RESULT:
**‚ùå FAILED** 

### üí° SUMMARY:
The AI response successfully provides a tutorial-based overview of the React useEffect hook and clearly states that it is derived from tutorial content. However, the discovery data includes chunks with parentGenres other than 'TUTORIAL', such as 'RHEINGOLD' and 'null', which violates the specified criteria. To improve, the system should ensure that only tutorial-related chunks are selected when the user requests 'tutorials only'.
