# no need but good to know 
- in the main file rag.cy.js I need to write inside the description the BeforeEach command and inside it put the auth login for e.de-staging (to run for each test case)


# important commands 
- cy.log to show message
- 

# CLI 
- npx cypress run -h // to show all commands 
- npx cypress run // to run all tests 
- npx cypress run - s "here the specific path to run"

# cache handling 
npx cypress cache (then I can add whatever I want)

Here‚Äôs a summary of the key topics discussed in various conference sessions related to Angular 20:\n\nServer-Side Rendering (SSR):\n\nAngular 20 enhances SSR capabilities, making it easier to create fast, SEO-friendly applications. The framework now supports hydration, allowing server-rendered HTML to be seamlessly integrated with client-side interactivity, improving performance and user experience 54793be95d590ed758230753Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Angular offers a powerful solution for creating fast, SEO-friendly web applications..\n\n\nSignals:\n\nSignals are a new reactive primitive introduced in Angular 20, allowing for more fine-grained control over change detection. This feature simplifies the management of state changes and enhances performance by reducing unnecessary checks across the component tree 6883afe7f10bc00f03909befSignals will lead to a different more fine-grained and more performant way of processing the Change Detection to update the view..\n\n\nStandalone Components:\n\nThe concept of standalone components is now fully integrated, allowing developers to create components without the need for NgModules. This change simplifies the architecture of Angular applications and reduces code complexity EKXrsvWfMMbg77YiGStandalone APIs make NgModules optional as well as RxJS and Zone.js will not be mandatory dependencies in the future anymore..\n\n\nControl Flow Syntax:\n\nAngular 20 introduces a new control flow syntax that enhances template readability and performance. This includes directives like add-if, add-for, and add-switch, which streamline common patterns in Angular applications eqEzQ8Wn6jGAbaxbWNew Control Flow syntax simplifies common use cases in templates significantly..\n\n\nPerformance Improvements:\n\nThe new build system, which replaces Webpack with ESBuild, promises faster build times and improved performance for Angular applications. This change is part of a broader effort to modernize the framework and enhance the developer experience 5ca564ac8c4557f4f949b660Angular hasn't gone through a time of innovation such as this since the creation of 2.0..\n\n\nMigration Strategies:\n\nSessions also covered strategies for migrating existing applications to leverage the new features in Angular 20, emphasizing the importance of backward compatibility and gradual adoption of new APIs mrkFPBdm5bQQ8Q8nYIt is your own decision which pace to use to refactor your own codebase to the latest framework features..\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, Angular 20 is set to bring significant advancements that enhance performance, simplify development, and improve the overall developer experience. The integration of signals, standalone components, and improved SSR capabilities are particularly noteworthy, making this an exciting time for Angular developers. For those looking to stay updated, attending sessions and engaging with the community will be invaluable as these features roll out.\n\nSources:\n\n54793be95d590ed758230753Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Angular offers a powerful solution for creating fast, SEO-friendly web applications.
