If the feature or method or solution was introduced in an older version and not re-mentioned in newer version document chunks, use the older document chunks and indicate it applies to version {query_version} unless explicitly deprecated.","Check that RAG selects chunks that mention Angular Signals and Angular 17 explicitly.
If not mentioned in v17 chunks, fallback to older chunk is allowed with clear version explanation.
Ensure no assumptions based on title, version metadata or document date.
